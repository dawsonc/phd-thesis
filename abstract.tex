Before robots can be deployed in safety-critical environments, we must be able to verify they they will perform safely, ideally without the risk or expense of real-world testing. A wide variety of formal methods and simulation-driven techniques have been developed to conduct this verification, but they typically rely on difficult-to-construct mathematical models or else use sample-inneficient black-box optimization methods.

In this thesis, we develop a suite of methods that use program analysis tools, including automatic differentiation and probabilistic programming, to automatically construct mathematical models of the system under test and accelerate verification of robots and other autonomous systems. In particular, we make the following contributions. First, we use automatic differentiation to develop a flexible, general-purpose framework for end-to-end design automation and statistical safety verification for autonomous systems. Second, we improve the sample efficiency of end-to-end optimization using adversarial optimization to falsify differentiable formal specifications of desired robot behavior. Third, we provide a novel reformulation of the design and verification problem as a Bayesian inference (rather than optimization) problem to predict a more diverse set of challenging adversarial failure modes. Finally, we present a data-driven method for root-cause failure diagnosis, allowing system designers to infer what factors may have contributed to failure based on noisy, limited data from real-world deployments.

We apply the methods developed in this thesis to a range of challenging problems in robotics and cyberphysical system design. We demonstrate the use of our design and verification framework to optimize spacecraft trajectory and control systems, multi-agent formation and communication strategies, vision-in-the-loop controllers for autonomous vehicles, and robust generation dispatch for electrical power systems, and we apply our failure diagnosis tool on real-world data from scheduling failures in a nationwide air transportation network.
