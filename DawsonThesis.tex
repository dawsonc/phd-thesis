\documentclass[twoside]{mitthesis} %,fontset=libertine, fontset=newtx-sans-text, fontset=heros-stix2, fontset=stix2
%
% option [twoside]		gives facing-page behavior for printing; omitting twoside will eliminate even-numbered blank pages.
% option [lineno]	 	provides line numbers, as for editing
% option [mydesign] 	loads packages for color, title and list formats, margins, or captions: edit mydesign.tex to change defaults.
% option [fontset] is a keyvalue which can be:
%					 	pdftex or unicode engines:  defaultfonts, libertine, lucida
%					 	pdftex only: 				fira-newtxsf, newtx, newtx-sans-text
%						unicode engines (luatex):	heros-stix2, stix2, termes, termes-stix2
%					 	if no key value is given, fonts default to CMR (pdftex) or LMR (unicode), i.e., "the LaTeX font".
%					 	You can edit the fontset files or you can write your own, myfonts.tex, and do [fontset=myfonts].
%						If you are using multiple languages, load the babel package in your fontset file, before the fonts.

\addbibresource{main.bib}

\usepackage{mymacros}

%% to avoid split urls and stretched white space, you can set the bibliography ragged-right:
%\appto{\bibsetup}{\raggedright}

% biblatex is very powerful, and you can customize most aspects the reference list and citations to suit your needs.
% documentation is here: https://ctan.org/pkg/biblatex


%%%%%%%%%%  Option to use natbib   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\RequirePackage[numbers,sort&compress]{natbib}
 
%%% add bibliography to table of contents
%\apptocmd{\bibliography}{\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\protect\textbf{\bibname}}}{}{}

%%% You can use this to rename the bibliography section
%\renewcommand{\bibname}{References}

%%% Can adjust space between bibliography items (change 4pt to something else; don't drop last two lengths, they are stretchable "glue")
%\setlength\bibsep{4pt plus 1pt minus 1pt}


%%%%%%%%%%  Table related packages  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\usepackage{booktabs}% better quality tables, https://ctan.org/pkg/booktabs
\usepackage{array}%    additional options for table columns, https://ctan.org/pkg/array

%\usepackage{tabularx}%   https://ctan.org/pkg/tabularx

%\usepackage{dcolumn}%    alignment on decimal place, https://ctan.org/pkg/dcolumn
%\newcolumntype{d}[1]{D{.}{.}{#1}}


%%%%%%%%%%  Option for "double spacing" %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%% Back in the typewriter era, double spaced lines were convenient for editing with a pencil. 
%% In typography, the separation between lines is called "leading", and it is usually set in 
%% proportion to the font size (i.e., when the font is loaded).  If you really feel the need 
%% to change the line separation, the most attractive results will be obtained by changing the
%% leading in proportion to the the current font size, rather than just doubling the space.

%% The setspace package provides a tool for changing line separation. Use these two commands here:
%
% \usepackage{setspace}%  documentation at https://ctan.org/pkg/setspace
% \setstretch{1.1}% you can choose some other value for the stretch of space between lines
%
%% Use one or more of the these commands AFTER the frontmatter
%
% \onehalfspacing
% \doublespacing
% \singlespacing  % will turn these effects off (you can use these anywhere in the document)

%% The best result may be to stay with leading selected by the typographer who set up the font.


%%%%%%%%%%%  Metadata  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% Most of the document metadata is created automatically. 
% The following items should be adjusted to match your work. <================= !!!!!!!!!!

\hypersetup{%  % TODO
	pdfsubject={Template for writing MIT theses with the mitthesis class},
	% Change this to briefly state topic of your thesis 
% 
	pdfkeywords={Massachusetts Institute of Technology, MIT},
	% Add keywords that will help search engines and libraries to find your work.
	% Includes the name[s] of the author[s] 
	% (If you have used \DocumentMetadata, at line 15, you can just put "\CopyrightAuthor," for the names.)
%
	pdfurl={},
	% If you have a url for the thesis, put it here. Otherwise delete this.
	% (MIT Libraries will put your thesis in DSPACE with a persistent url after you submit it.)
%	
	pdfcontactemail={},
	% You can put a [permanent] email address into the metadata, if you like.
	% Otherwise delete this.

	pdfauthortitle={},
	% If you have a title, you can include it here.

% Note that third, fourth, fifth, and sixth arguments are optional [] and may be omitted

% note on names: most of the following names are made up; Silas Holman was a physics professor at MIT in the 19th century.

\Author{Charles Burke Dawson}{Department of Aeronautics and Astronautics}[B.S. Engineering, Harvey Mudd College, 2019][M.S. Aeronautics and Astronautics, MIT, 2021]

% Use once for each degree fulfilled by thesis
% For two degrees from one department, leave the department argument blank for the second degree {}.
% \Degree{Bachelor of Science in Physics}{Department of Physics}
% \Degree{Master of Science in Physics}{}

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \Supervisor command for each.

%%%%%%%  Solutions for overflowing titlepage  %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

% If your title page is overflowing (from too many names, degrees, etc.):
%
% (a) you can reduce the 12pt and 18pt skips between various blocks to 6pt with this command:
%
% \Tighten
%
% (b)  you can scale down the Signature block at the bottom with this command:
%
% \SignatureBlockSize{\small}  %or this one \SignatureBlockSize{\footnotesize}
%
% (c) you can put the acceptor name and title onto two lines, rather than three like this:
%
% \Acceptor{Tertius Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Research}{}
% \Acceptor{Quarta Castor}{Professor and Graduate Officer, Department of Mechanical Engineering}{}
%
% (d) you can change the font size of the the author name[s] with
%
%	\AuthorNameSize{\normalsize}
%
% (e) and you can omit any previous degrees from the title page, instead mentioning them in the Biosketch

% Also, if you prefer to keep the text toward the top of the page with most white space at the bottom, you
% can you this command to squash all of the vertical glue (stretchy space) with this command:
%
% \Squash 
%
% This command is useful when the text has not already reach the bottom of the page, since the glue gets squashed automatically
% when the page is too full.
