  abstract = {Many industrial cyber-physical system (CPS) designs are too complex to formally verify system-level properties. A practical approach for testing and debugging these system designs is falsification, wherein the user provides a temporal logic specification of correct system behaviors, and some technique for selecting test cases is used to identify behaviors that demonstrate that the specification does not hold for the system. While coverage metrics are often used to measure the exhaustiveness of this kind of testing approach for software systems, existing falsification approaches for CPS designs do not consider coverage for the signal variables. We present a new coverage measure for continuous signals and a new falsification technique that leverages the measure to efficiently identify falsifying traces. This falsification algorithm combines global and local search methods and uses a classification technique based on support vector machines to identify regions of the search space on which to focus effort. We use an industrial example from an automotive fuel cell application and other benchmark models to compare the new approach against existing falsification tools.},

In this work we rigorously prove that with minimal algorithmic modifications, both HMC and NUTS can be combined with transition functions that are not necessarily volume preserving. In light of these results, we propose a non-volume preserving transition function that conserves the Hamiltonian better than the baseline leapfrog mechanism, on piecewise-continuous distributions. The resulting samplers do not require any assumptions on the geometry of the discontinuity boundaries, and our experimental results show a significant improvement upon traditional HMC and NUTS.},

However, large-scale stochastic optimization remains computationally challenging due to the wide range of potential probabilistic outcomes and the non-convexity of the AC network constraints. Using a minimax formulation rooted in robust optimization, we define a generic methodology to obtain a feasible dispatch that accommodates the probabilistic nature of loads and renewable generation sources. We introduce a method to efficiently solve this minimax formulation, adopting techniques from the literature on adversarial robustness in machine learning to improve scalability and convergence. We demonstrate that our method maintains AC feasibility over a wide range of probabilistic scenarios, and demonstrate the scalability of our method by determining a dispatch for a synthetic 11,000 bus system.},

  abstract = {Today's robots often interface data-driven perception and planning models with classical model-predictive controllers (MPC). Often, such learned perception/planning models produce erroneous waypoint predictions on out-of-distribution (OoD) or even adversarial visual inputs, which increase control cost. However, today's methods to train robust perception models are largely task-agnostic -- they augment a dataset using random image transformations or adversarial examples targeted at the vision model in isolation. As such, they often introduce pixel perturbations that are ultimately benign for control. In contrast to prior work that synthesizes adversarial examples for single-step vision tasks, our key contribution is to synthesize adversarial scenarios tailored to multi-step, model-based control. To do so, we use differentiable MPC methods to calculate the sensitivity of a model-based controller to errors in state estimation. We show that re-training vision models on these adversarial datasets improves control performance on OoD test scenarios by up to 36.2\% compared to standard task-agnostic data augmentation. We demonstrate our method on examples of robotic navigation, manipulation in RoboSuite, and control of an autonomous air vehicle.},

This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver's solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.},

The corresponding optimal distribution of estimators, usually called the Gibbs posterior, is unfortunately often intractable. One may sample from it using Markov chain Monte Carlo, but this is usually too slow for big datasets. We consider instead variational approximations of the Gibbs posterior, which are fast to compute. We undertake a general study of the properties of such approximations. Our main finding is that such a variational approximation has often the same rate of convergence as the original PAC-Bayesian procedure it approximates. In addition, we show that, when the risk function is convex, a variational approximation can be obtained in polynomial time using a convex solver. We give finite sample oracle inequalities for the corresponding estimator. We specialize our results to several learning tasks (classification, ranking, matrix completion), discuss how to implement a variational approximation in each case, and illustrate the good properties of said approximation on real datasets.},

In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.},

The scope of this review covers peer-reviewed research papers proposing, improving or evaluating testing techniques, process, or tools that address the system-level qualities of RAS. Our survey is performed based on a rigorous methodology structured in three phases. First, we made use of a set of 26 seed papers (selected by domain experts) and the SERP-TEST taxonomy to design our search query and (domain-specific) taxonomy. Second, we conducted a search in three academic search engines and applied our inclusion and exclusion criteria to the results. Respectively, we made use of related work and domain specialists (50 academics and 15 industry experts) to validate and refine the search query. As a result, we encountered 10,735 studies, out of which, 195 were included, reviewed and coded. Our objective is to answer four research questions, pertaining to (1) the type of models, (2) measures for system performance and testing adequacy, (3) tools and their availability, and (4) evidence of applicability, particularly in industrial contexts. We analyse the results of our coding to identify strengths and gaps in the domain and present recommendations to researchers and practitioners. Our findings show that variants of temporal logics are most widely used for modelling requirements and properties, while variants of state-machines and transition systems are used widely for modelling system behaviour. Other common models concern epistemic logics for specifying requirements and belief-desire-intention models for specifying system behaviour. Apart from time and epistemics, other aspects captured in models concern probabilities (e.g., for modelling uncertainty) and continuous trajectories (e.g., for modelling vehicle dynamics and kinematics). Many papers lack any rigorous measure of efficiency, effectiveness, or adequacy for their proposed techniques, processes, or tools. Among those that provide a measure of efficiency, effectiveness, or adequacy the majority use domain-agnostic generic measures such as number of failures, size of state-space or verification time were most used. There is a trend in addressing the research gap in this respect by developing domain-specific notions of performance and adequacy. Defining widely-accepted rigorous measures of performance and adequacy for each domain is an identified research gap. In terms of tools, the most widely used tools are well-established model-checkers such as Prism and Uppaal, as well as simulation tools such as Gazebo; Matlab/Simulink is another widely used toolset in this domain. Overall there is very limited evidence of industrial applicability in the papers published in this domain. There is even a gap considering consolidated benchmarks for various types of autonomous systems.},

Simulation provides a useful platform to evaluate the extremal risks of these systems before their deployments. Importance Sampling (IS), while proven to be powerful for rare-event simulation, faces challenges in handling these learning-based systems due to their black-box nature that fundamentally undermines its efficiency guarantee, which can lead to under-estimation without diagnostically detected. We propose a framework called Deep Probabilistic Accelerated Evaluation (Deep-PrAE) to design statistically guaranteed IS, by converting black-box samplers that are versatile but could lack guarantees, into one with what we call a relaxed efficiency certificate that allows accurate estimation of bounds on the safety-critical event probability. We present the theory of Deep-PrAE that combines the dominating point concept with rare-event set learning via deep neural network classifiers, and demonstrate its effectiveness in numerical examples including the safety-testing of an intelligent driving algorithm.},

Unfortunately, these models may be unable to represent any particular image because of architectural choices, mode collapse, and bias in the training dataset. In this paper, we demonstrate that invertible neural networks, which have zero representation error by design, can be effective natural signal priors at inverse problems such as denoising, compressive sensing, and inpainting. Given a trained generative model, we study the empirical risk formulation of the desired inverse problem under a regularization that promotes high likelihood images, either directly by penalization or algorithmically by initialization. For compressive sensing, invertible priors can yield higher accuracy than sparsity priors across almost all undersampling ratios, and due to their lack of representation error, invertible priors can yield better reconstructions than GAN priors for images that have rare features of variation within the biased training set, including out-of-distribution natural images. We additionally compare performance for compressive sensing to unlearned methods, such as the deep decoder, and we establish theoretical bounds on expected recovery error in the case of a linear invertible model.},

  abstract = {Simulations are a practical method of increasing the confidence that a system design is correct. This paper presents techniques which aim to determine all the states that can be reached using a particular hybrid automaton simulation algorithm, a property we call simulation-equivalent reachability. Although this is a slightly weaker property than traditional reachability, its computation can be efficient and accurate. We present HyLAA, the first tool for simulation-equivalent reachability for hybrid automata with affine dynamics. HyLAA's analysis is exact; upon completion, the tool provides a concrete simulation trace to an unsafe state if and only if the hybrid automaton simulation engine could produce such a trace. In the backend, the tool implements an efficient algorithm for continuous post that exploits the superposition principle of linear systems, requiring only n+1 simulations per mode for an n-dimensional linear system. This technique is capable of analyzing a replicated helicopter system with over 1000 state variables in less than 20 minutes. The tool also contains several novel performance enhancements, such as invariant constraint elimination, warm-start linear programming, and trace-guided set deaggregation.},

The main challenge is addressing its exponential computational complexity with respect to the number of state variables. In this tutorial, we present an overview of basic HJ reachability theory and provide instructions for using the most recent numerical tools, including an efficient GPU-parallelized implementation of a Level Set Toolbox for computing reachable sets.

However, the computation graph of GANs, that include a stochastic policy as the generative model, is no longer differentiable end-to-end, which requires the use of high-variance gradient estimation. In this paper, we introduce the Model-based Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (MGAIL) algorithm. We show how to use a forward model to make the computation fully differentiable, which enables training policies using the exact gradient of the discriminator. The resulting algorithm trains competent policies using relatively fewer expert samples and interactions with the environment. We test it on both discrete and continuous action domains and report results that surpass the state-of-the-art.},

Solvers based on SMT are used as back-end engines in model-checking applications such as bounded, interpolation-based, and predicate-abstraction-based model checking. After a brief illustration of these uses, we survey the predominant techniques for solving SMT problems with an emphasis on the lazy approach, in which a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver is combined with one or more theory solvers. We discuss the architecture of a lazy SMT solver, give examples of theory solvers, show how to combine such solvers modularly, and mention several extensions of the lazy approach. We also briefly describe the eager approach in which the SMT problem is reduced to a SAT problem. Finally, we discuss how the basic framework for determining satisfiability can be extended with additional functionality such as producing models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.},

Due to the non-convexity of the problem, dominant approaches in this area rely on convex approximations, which are inherently loose. In this paper, we question the effectiveness of such approaches for realistic computer vision tasks. First, we provide extensive empirical evidence to show that certified defences suffer not only worse accuracy but also worse robustness and fairness than empirical defences. We hypothesise that the reason for why certified defences suffer in generalisation is (i) the large number of relaxed non-convex constraints and (ii) strong alignment between the adversarial perturbations and the "signal" direction. We provide a combination of theoretical and experimental evidence to support these hypotheses.},

  abstract = {In control theory, complicated dynamics such as systems of (nonlinear) differential equations are controlled mostly to achieve stability. This fundamental property, which can be with respect to a desired operating point or a prescribed trajectory, is often linked with optimality, which requires minimizing a certain cost along the trajectories of a stable system. In formal verification (model checking), simple systems, such as finite-state transition graphs that model computer programs or digital circuits, are checked against rich specifications given as formulas of temporal logics. The formal synthesis problem, in which the goal is to synthesize or control a finite system from a temporal logic specification, has recently received increased interest. In this article, we review some recent results on the connection between optimal control and formal synthesis. Specifically, we focus on the following problem: Given a cost and a correctness temporal logic specification for a dynamical system, generate an optimal control strategy that satisfies the specification. We first provide a short overview of automata-based methods, in which the dynamics of the system are mapped to a finite abstraction that is then controlled using an automaton corresponding to the specification. We then provide a detailed overview of a class of methods that rely on mapping the specification and the dynamics to constraints of an optimization problem. We discuss advantages and limitations of these two types of approaches and suggest directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Stochastic neurons and hard non-linearities can be useful for a number of reasons in deep learning models, but in many cases they pose a challenging problem: how to estimate the gradient of a loss function with respect to the input of such stochastic or non-smooth neurons? I.e., can we "back-propagate" through these stochastic neurons? We examine this question, existing approaches, and compare four families of solutions, applicable in different settings. One of them is the minimum variance unbiased gradient estimator for stochatic binary neurons (a special case of the REINFORCE algorithm). A second approach, introduced here, decomposes the operation of a binary stochastic neuron into a stochastic binary part and a smooth differentiable part, which approximates the expected effect of the pure stochatic binary neuron to first order. A third approach involves the injection of additive or multiplicative noise in a computational graph that is otherwise differentiable. A fourth approach heuristically copies the gradient with respect to the stochastic output directly as an estimator of the gradient with respect to the sigmoid argument (we call this the straight-through estimator). To explore a context where these estimators are useful, we consider a small-scale version of \{{\textbackslash}em conditional computation\}, where sparse stochastic units form a distributed representation of gaters that can turn off in combinatorially many ways large chunks of the computation performed in the rest of the neural network. In this case, it is important that the gating units produce an actual 0 most of the time. The resulting sparsity can be potentially be exploited to greatly reduce the computational cost of large deep networks for which conditional computation would be useful.},

As a practical and sound approximation, we introduce a weight-aware interval type system, which automatically infers interval bounds on not just the return value but also weight of program executions, simultaneously. We have built a tool implementation, called GuBPI, which automatically computes these posterior lower/upper bounds. Our evaluation on examples from the literature shows that the bounds are useful, and can even be used to recognise wrong outputs from stochastic posterior inference procedures.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to first posit a family of densities and then to find the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-field variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the notion of quantitative resilience of a control system. Following prior work, we study linear driftless systems enduring a loss of control authority over some of their actuators. Such a malfunction results in actuators producing possibly undesirable inputs over which the controller has real-time readings but no control. By definition, a system is resilient if it can still reach a target after a partial loss of control authority. However, after such a malfunction, a resilient system might be significantly slower to reach a target compared to its initial capabilities. We quantify this loss of performance through the new concept of quantitative resilience. We define such a metric as the maximal ratio of the minimal times required to reach any target for the initial and malfunctioning systems. Na\"{\i}ve computation of quantitative resilience directly from the definition is a complex task as it requires solving four nested, possibly nonlinear, optimization problems. The main technical contribution of this work is to provide an efficient method to compute quantitative resilience. Relying on control theory and on two novel geometric results we reduce the computation of quantitative resilience to a single linear optimization problem. We demonstrate our method on an opinion dynamics scenario.},

  abstract = {Iterative inversion methods have been unsuccessful at inverting seismic data obtained from complicated earth models (e.g. the Marmousi model), the primary difficulty being the presence of numerous local minima in the objective function. The presence of local minima at all scales in the seismic inversion problem prevent iterative methods of inversion from attaining a reasonable degree of convergence to the neighborhood of the global minimum. The multigrid method is a technique that improves the performance of iterative inversion by decomposing the problem by scale. At long scales there are fewer local minima and those that remain are further apart from each other. Thus, at long scales iterative methods can get closer to the neighborhood of the global minimum. We apply the multigrid method to a subsampled, low-frequency version of the Marmousi data set. Although issues of source estimation, source bandwidth, and noise are not treated, results show that iterative inversion methods perform much better when employed with a decomposition by scale. Furthermore, the method greatly reduces the computational burden of the inversion that will be of importance for 3-D extensions to the method.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to present a literature review of the AC Optimal Power Flow (ACOPF) problem and propose areas where the ACOPF could be improved. The ACOPF is at the heart of Independent System Operator (ISO) power markets, and is solved in some form every year for system planning, every day for day-ahead markets, every hour, and even every 5 minutes. It was first formulated in 1962, and formulations have changed little over the years. With advances in computing power and solution algorithms, we can model more of the constraints and remove unnecessary limits and approximations that were previously required to find a solution in reasonable time. One example is nonlinear voltage magnitude constraints that are modeled as linear thermal proxy constraints. In this paper, we refer to the full ACOPF as an ACOPF that simultaneously optimizes real and reactive power. Today, 50 years after the problem was formulated, we still do not have a fast, robust solution technique for the full ACOPF. Finding a good solution technique for the full ACOPF could potentially save tens of billions of dollars annually. Based on our literature review, we find that the ACOPF research community lacks a common understanding of the problem, its formulation, and objective functions. However, we do not claim that this literature review is a complete review---our intent was simply to capture the major formulations of the ACOPF. Instead, in this paper, we seek to clearly present the ACOPF problem through clear formulations of the problem and its parameters. This paper defines and discusses the polar power-voltage, rectangular power-voltage, and rectangular current-voltage formulations of the ACOPF. Additionally, it discusses the different types of constraints and objective functions. This paper lays the groundwork for further research on the convex approximation of the ACOPF solution space, a survey of solution techniques, and computational performance of different formulations.},

Then we deal with the challenges to the techniques for solving the SCOPF, focusing mainly on: approaches to reduce the size of the problem by either efficiently identifying the binding contingencies and including only these contingencies in the SCOPF or by using approximate models for the post-contingency states, and the handling of discrete variables. We finally address the current trend of extending the SCOPF formulation to take into account the increasing levels of uncertainty in the operation planning. For each such topic we provide a review of the state of the art, we identify the advances that are needed, and we indicate ways to bridge the gap between the current state of the art and these needs.},

The procedure terminates when no counterexample is found by the falsifier, in which case the controlled nonlinear system is provably stable. The approach significantly simplifies the process of Lyapunov control design, provides end-to-end correctness guarantee, and can obtain much larger regions of attraction than existing methods such as LQR and SOS/SDP.

  abstract = {We present a program analysis for verifying quantitative robustness properties of programs, stated generally as: "If the inputs of a program are perturbed by an arbitrary amount epsilon, then its outputs change at most by (K . epsilon), where K can depend on the size of the input but not its value." Robustness properties generalize the analytic notion of continuity---e.g., while the function ex is continuous, it is not robust. Our problem is to verify the robustness of a function P that is coded as an imperative program, and can use diverse data types and features such as branches and loops. Our approach to the problem soundly decomposes it into two subproblems: (a) verifying that the smallest possible perturbations to the inputs of P do not change the corresponding outputs significantly, even if control now flows along a different control path; and (b) verifying the robustness of the computation along each control-flow path of P. To solve the former subproblem, we build on an existing method for verifying that a program encodes a continuous function [5]. The latter is solved using a static analysis that bounds the magnitude of the slope of any function computed by a control flow path of P. The outcome is a sound program analysis for robustness that uses proof obligations which do not refer to epsilon-changes and can often be fully automated using off-the-shelf SMT-solvers. We identify three application domains for our analysis. First, our analysis can be used to guarantee the predictable execution of embedded control software, whose inputs come from physical sources and can suffer from error and uncertainty. A guarantee of robustness ensures that the system does not react disproportionately to such uncertainty. Second, our analysis is directly applicable to approximate computation, and can be used to provide foundations for a recently-proposed program approximation scheme called \{loop perforation\}. A third application is in database privacy: proofs of robustness of queries are essential to differential privacy, the most popular notion of privacy for statistical databases.},

Algorithms for the two tasks, such as normalizing flows and generative adversarial networks (GANs), are often developed independently. In this paper, we propose the concept of continuous-time flows (CTFs), a family of diffusion-based methods that are able to asymptotically approach a target distribution. Distinct from normalizing flows and GANs, CTFs can be adopted to achieve the above two goals in one framework, with theoretical guarantees. Our framework includes distilling knowledge from a CTF for efficient inference, and learning an explicit energy-based distribution with CTFs for density estimation. Both tasks rely on a new technique for distribution matching within amortized learning. Experiments on various tasks demonstrate promising performance of the proposed CTF framework, compared to related techniques.},

DiffTune has been proposed as an automatic tuning method that unrolls the dynamical system and controller into a computational graph and uses auto-differentiation to obtain the gradient for the controller's parameter update. However, DiffTune uses the vanilla gradient descent to iteratively update the parameter, in which the performance largely depends on the choice of the learning rate (as a hyperparameter). In this paper, we propose to use hyperparameter-free methods to update the controller parameters. We find the optimal parameter update by maximizing the loss reduction, where a predicted loss based on the approximated state and control is used for the maximization. Two methods are proposed to optimally update the parameters and are compared with related variants in simulations on a Dubin's car and a quadrotor. Simulation experiments show that the proposed first-order method outperforms the hyperparameter-based methods and is more robust than the second-order hyperparameter-free methods.},

Can this timing guarantee be formally verified? We leverage our work on the functional reactive programming (FRP) model to predict the worst-case response time (WCRT) of fault-tolerant classical computing systems since the timing analysis of re-executions for fault recovery plus transient-faults-induced wasted execution times is similar to determining the response time of FRP tasks. Ongoing work shows that accounting for wasted execution times due to errors in quantum computers resulting from quantum decoherence and state fidelity can be treated similarly and develops a mapping from quantum programs to FRP programs for efficient timing analysis.},

For training, we show how to scalably backpropagate through any ODE solver, without access to its internal operations. This allows end-to-end training of ODEs within larger models.},

The translation between natural language (NL) and TL has been under-explored due to the lack of dataset and generalizable model across different application domains. In this paper, we propose an accurate and generalizable transformation framework of English instructions from NL to TL, exploring the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) at multiple stages. Our contributions are twofold. First, we develop a framework to create a dataset of NL-TL pairs combining LLMs and human annotation. We publish a dataset with 23K NL-TL pairs. Then, we finetune T5 models on the lifted versions (i.e., the specific Atomic Propositions (AP) are hidden) of the NL and TL. The enhanced generalizability originates from two aspects: 1) Usage of lifted NL-TL characterizes common logical structures, without constraints of specific domains. 2) Application of LLMs in dataset creation largely enhances corpus richness. We test the generalization of trained models on five varied domains. To achieve full NL-TL transformation, we either combine the lifted model with AP recognition task or do the further finetuning on each specific domain. During the further finetuning, our model achieves higher accuracy ({\textbackslash}textgreater 95\%) using only {\textbackslash}textless10\% training data, compared with the baseline sequence to sequence (Seq2Seq) model.},

The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recent years. However, a limitation of HMC methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system-such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient HMC approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

We explore various solutions based on two ideas: domain contraction and range over-approximation. Instead of explicitly computing the intersection of a Taylor model with a guard set, domain contraction makes the domain of a Taylor model smaller by cutting away parts for which the intersection is empty. It is complemented by range over-approximation that translates Taylor models into commonly used representations such as template polyhedra or zonotopes, on which intersections with guard sets have been previously studied. We provide an implementation of the techniques described in the paper and evaluate the various design choices over a set of challenging benchmarks.},

  abstract = {In this work we target a learnable output representation that allows continuous, high resolution outputs of arbitrary shape. Recent works represent 3D surfaces implicitly with a Neural Network, thereby breaking previous barriers in resolution, and ability to represent diverse topologies. However, neural implicit representations are limited to closed surfaces, which divide the space into inside and outside. Many real world objects such as walls of a scene scanned by a sensor, clothing, or a car with inner structures are not closed. This constitutes a significant barrier, in terms of data pre-processing (objects need to be artificially closed creating artifacts), and the ability to output open surfaces. In this work, we propose Neural Distance Fields (NDF), a neural network based model which predicts the unsigned distance field for arbitrary 3D shapes given sparse point clouds. NDF represent surfaces at high resolutions as prior implicit models, but do not require closed surface data, and significantly broaden the class of representable shapes in the output. NDF allow to extract the surface as very dense point clouds and as meshes. We also show that NDF allow for surface normal calculation and can be rendered using a slight modification of sphere tracing. We find NDF can be used for multi-target regression (multiple outputs for one input) with techniques that have been exclusively used for rendering in graphics. Experiments on ShapeNet show that NDF, while simple, is the state-of-the art, and allows to reconstruct shapes with inner structures, such as the chairs inside a bus. Notably, we show that NDF are not restricted to 3D shapes, and can approximate more general open surfaces such as curves, manifolds, and functions.

  abstract = {This paper introduces Diffusion Policy, a new way of generating robot behavior by representing a robot's visuomotor policy as a conditional denoising diffusion process. We benchmark Diffusion Policy across 11 different tasks from 4 different robot manipulation benchmarks and find that it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art robot learning methods with an average improvement of 46.9\%. Diffusion Policy learns the gradient of the action-distribution score function and iteratively optimizes with respect to this gradient field during inference via a series of stochastic Langevin dynamics steps. We find that the diffusion formulation yields powerful advantages when used for robot policies, including gracefully handling multimodal action distributions, being suitable for high-dimensional action spaces, and exhibiting impressive training stability. To fully unlock the potential of diffusion models for visuomotor policy learning on physical robots, this paper presents a set of key technical contributions including the incorporation of receding horizon control, visual conditioning, and the time-series diffusion transformer. We hope this work will help motivate a new generation of policy learning techniques that are able to leverage the powerful generative modeling capabilities of diffusion models. Code, data, and training details will be publicly available.},

One proposal to scale OoD detection to high-dimensional data is to learn a tractable likelihood approximation of the training distribution, and use it to reject unlikely inputs. However, likelihood models on natural data are themselves susceptible to OoD errors, and even assign large likelihoods to samples from other datasets. To mitigate this problem, we propose Generative Ensembles, which robustify density-based OoD detection by way of estimating epistemic uncertainty of the likelihood model. We present a puzzling observation in need of an explanation -- although likelihood measures cannot account for the typical set of a distribution, and therefore should not be suitable on their own for OoD detection, WAIC performs surprisingly well in practice.},

Our hypothesis is that if it is possible to compute a 'large enough' controlled invariant set either for the actual system model or some simplification of the system model, interesting corner cases for other control designs can be generated by sampling initial conditions from the boundary of this controlled invariant set. Moreover, if falsifying trajectories for a given control design can be found through such sampling, then the controlled invariant set can be used as a supervisor to ensure safe operation of the control design under consideration. In addition to interesting initial conditions, which are mostly related to safety violations in transients, we use solutions from a dual game, a reachability game for the safety specification, to find falsifying inputs. We also propose optimization-based heuristics for input generation for cases when the state is outside the winning set of the dual game. To demonstrate the proposed ideas, we consider case studies from basic autonomous driving functionality, in particular, adaptive cruise control and lane keeping. We show how the proposed technique can be used to find interesting falsifying trajectories for classical control designs like proportional controllers, proportional integral controllers and model predictive controllers, as well as an open source real-world autonomous driving package.},

Real world vehicle testing is commonly employed for autonomous vehicle validation, but the costs and time requirements are high. Consequently, simulation driven methods such as Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) have been proposed to aid in validation. AST formulates the problem of finding the most likely failure scenarios as a Markov decision process, which can be solved using reinforcement learning. In practice, AST tends to find scenarios where failure is unavoidable and tends to repeatedly discover the same types of failures of a system. This work addresses these issues by encoding domain relevant information into the search procedure. With this modification, the AST method discovers a larger and more expressive subset of the failure space when compared to the original AST formulation. We show that our approach is able to identify useful failure scenarios of an autonomous vehicle policy.},

  abstract = {Autonomous cyber-physical systems (CPS) can improve safety and efficiency for safety-critical applications, but require rigorous testing before deployment. The complexity of these systems often precludes the use of formal verification and real-world testing can be too dangerous during development. Therefore, simulation-based techniques have been developed that treat the system under test as a black box operating in a simulated environment. Safety validation tasks include finding disturbances in the environment that cause the system to fail (falsification), finding the most-likely failure, and estimating the probability that the system fails. Motivated by the prevalence of safety-critical artificial intelligence, this work provides a survey of state-of-the-art safety validation techniques for CPS with a focus on applied algorithms and their modifications for the safety validation problem. We present and discuss algorithms in the domains of optimization, path planning, reinforcement learning, and importance sampling. Problem decomposition techniques are presented to help scale algorithms to large state spaces, which are common for CPS. A brief overview of safety-critical applications is given, including autonomous vehicles and aircraft collision avoidance systems. Finally, we present a survey of existing academic and commercially available safety validation tools.},

The technique, which is implemented as part of the Gen probabilistic programming system, also automatically detects user errors in the specification of involutive MCMC kernels and exploits sparsity in the kernels for improved efficiency.

In many situations, exact sampling from a given distribution is impossible or computationally expensive and, therefore, one needs to resort to approximate sampling strategies. However, there is no well-developed theory providing meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees for the approximate sampling procedures, especially in high dimensional problems. The paper makes some progress in this direction by considering the problem of sampling from a distribution having a smooth and log-concave density defined on R{$\rho$}, for some integer P{$>$}0. We establish non-asymptotic bounds for the error of approximating the target distribution by the distribution obtained by the Langevin Monte Carlo method and its variants. We illustrate the effectiveness of the established guarantees with various experiments. Underlying our analysis are insights from the theory of continuous time diffusion processes, which may be of interest beyond the framework of log-concave densities that are considered in the present work.},

For instance, in differential privacy, one of the most common mechanisms for turning a (possibly privacy-leaking) query into a differentially private one involves establishing a bound on its sensitivity. One approach to sensitivity analysis is to use a type-based approach, extending the Hindley-Milner type system with functional types capturing statically the sensitivity of a functional expression. This approach - based on affine logic - has been used in Fuzz, a language for differentially private queries. We describe an automatic typed-based analysis that infers and checks the sensitivity annotations for simple functional programs. We have implemented a prototype in Fuzz's compiler. The first component of the analysis extends the typechecker to generate nonlinear constraints over the positive real numbers extended with infinity, which are then checked by the Z3 SMT solver; a solution for them will provide an upper bound on the sensitivity annotations and ensure the correctness of the annotations. We also present a simple sensitivity minimization procedure and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach by analyzing several examples. {\copyright} 2013 by the Association for Computing Machinery, Inc.

We frame this problem through the lens of approximate Bayesian inference and use differentiable simulation for efficient failure case prediction and repair. We apply our approach on a range of robotics and control problems, including optimizing search patterns for robot swarms and reducing the severity of outages in power transmission networks. Compared to optimization-based falsification techniques, our method predicts a more diverse, representative set of failure modes, and we also find that our use of differentiable simulation yields solutions that have up to 10x lower cost and requires up to 2x fewer iterations to converge relative to gradient-free techniques.},

  abstract = {Many robotic tasks require high-dimensional sensors such as cameras and Lidar to navigate complex environments, but developing certifiably safe feedback controllers around these sensors remains a challenging open problem, particularly when learning is involved. Previous works have proved the safety of perception-feedback controllers by separating the perception and control subsystems and making strong assumptions on the abilities of the perception subsystem. In this work, we introduce a novel learning-enabled perception-feedback hybrid controller, where we use Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) and Control Lyapunov Functions (CLFs) to show the safety and liveness of a full-stack perception-feedback controller. We use neural networks to learn a CBF and CLF for the full-stack system directly in the observation space of the robot, without the need to assume a separate perception-based state estimator. Our hybrid controller, called LOCUS (Learning-enabled Observation-feedback Control Using Switching), can safely navigate unknown environments, consistently reach its goal, and generalizes safely to environments outside of the training dataset. We demonstrate LOCUS in experiments both in simulation and in hardware, where it successfully navigates a changing environment using feedback from a Lidar sensor.},

In this paper, we present an algorithm for finding robust plans that satisfy STL specifications. Our method alternates between local optimization and local falsification, using automatically differentiable temporal logic to iteratively optimize its plan in response to counterexamples found during the falsification process. We benchmark our counterexample-guided planning method against state-of-the-art planning methods on two long-horizon satellite rendezvous missions, showing that our method finds high-quality plans that satisfy STL specifications despite adversarial disturbances. We find that our method consistently finds plans that are robust to adversarial disturbances and requires less than half the time of competing methods.

In recent years, new techniques have emerged to provide these guarantees by learning certificates alongside control policies---these certificates provide concise data-driven proofs that guarantee the safety and stability of the learned control system. These methods not only allow the user to verify the safety of a learned controller but also provide supervision during training, allowing safety and stability requirements to influence the training process itself. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of this rapidly developing field of certificate learning. We hope that this article will serve as an accessible introduction to the theory and practice of certificate learning, both to those who wish to apply these tools to practical robotics problems and to those who wish to dive more deeply into the theory of learning for control.},

We find a variation in JSG{$\alpha$}, motivated by limiting cases, which leads to an intuitive interpolation between forward and reverse KL in the space of both distributions and divergences. We motivate its potential benefits for VAEs through low-dimensional examples, before presenting quantitative and qualitative results. Our experiments demonstrate that skewing our variant of JSG{$\alpha$}, in the context of JSG{$\alpha$} -VAEs, leads to better reconstruction and generation when compared to several baseline VAEs. Our approach is entirely unsupervised and utilises only one hyperparameter which can be easily interpreted in latent space.},

In the context of agent simulation for autonomous driving, this enables an automated way to target and produce challenging scenarios to stress-test the autonomous driving stack and hence accelerate validation and testing. Our approach leverages parametric signal temporal logic (pSTL) formulas to construct an interpretable view on the modeling parameters via a sequence of variational inference problems; one to solve for the pSTL parameters and another to construct a new parameterization satisfying the specification. We perform clustering on the new parameter space using a finite set of examples, either real or simulated, and combine computational graph learning and normalizing flows to form a relationship between these parameters and pSTL formulas either derived by hand or inferred from data. We illustrate the utility of our approach to model selection for validation of the safety properties of an autonomous driving system, using a learned generative model of the surrounding agents.},

The differences between the manifested behavior of the artifact and the predicted behavior of the model guide the search for the differences between the artifact and its model. The diagnostic procedure presented in this paper is model-based, inferring the behavior of the composite device from knowledge of the structure and function of the individual components comprising the device. The system (GDE---general diagnostic engine) has been implemented and tested on many examples in the domain of troubleshooting digital circuits. This research makes several novel contributions: First, the system diagnoses failures due to multiple faults. Second, failure candidates are represented and manipulated in terms of minimal sets of violated assumptions, resulting in an efficient diagnostic procedure. Third, the diagnostic procedure is incremental, exploiting the iterative nature of diagnosis. Fourth, a clear separation is drawn between diagnosis and behavior prediction, resulting in a domain (and inference procedure) independent diagnostic procedure. Fifth, GDE combines model-based prediction with sequential diagnosis to propose measurements to localize the faults. The normally required conditional probabilities are computed from the structure of the device and models of its components. This capability results from a novel way of incorporating probabilities and information theory into the context mechanism provided by assumption-based truth maintenance.},

Our approach is demonstrated in an inverted pendulum control system, an autonomous vehicle driving scenario, and a partially observable lunar lander. Sampling is performed using an off-the-shelf implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with multiple chains to capture multimodality and gradient smoothing for safe trajectories.

In most of these optimization problems, the objective to be maximized or minimized is composed of many different factors or terms that are local in nature---that is, they depend only on a small subset of the variables. A particularly insightful way of modeling this locality structure is to use the concept of factor graphs, a bipartite graphical model in which factors represent functions on subsets of variables. Factor graphs can represent a wide variety of problems across robotics, expose opportunities to improve computational performance, and are beneficial in designing and thinking about how to model a problem, even aside from performance considerations. I discuss each of these three aspects in detail and review several state-of-the-art robotics applications in which factor graphs have been used with great success.},

First, the corresponding SCOPF stochastic problem is defined so that the optimum solution is interpreted as a rare event to be reached by a random search. Second, the CE method solves this new problem efficiently by making adaptive changes to the probability density function according to the Kullback-Leibler distance, creating a sequence of density functions that guides the search in the direction of the theoretically degenerate density at the optimal point. Different types of density functions are tested in order to cope with discrete variables present in the SCOPF problem. Two test systems, namely the IEEE 57 bus and the IEEE 300 bus, are used to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of solution quality and computational effort. Comparisons carried out with reference algorithms in the literature demonstrate that the CE method is capable of finding better solutions for the SCOPF problem with fewer evaluations.},

The recent success of data-driven FWI methods results in a rapidly increasing demand for open datasets to serve the geophysics community. We present OpenFWI, a collection of large-scale multi-structural benchmark datasets, to facilitate diversified, rigorous, and reproducible research on FWI. In particular, OpenFWI consists of \$12\$ datasets (\$2.1\$TB in total) synthesized from multiple sources. It encompasses diverse domains in geophysics (interface, fault, CO\$\_2\$ reservoir, etc.), covers different geological subsurface structures (flat, curve, etc.), and contain various amounts of data samples (2K - 67K). It also includes a dataset for 3D FWI. Moreover, we use OpenFWI to perform benchmarking over four deep learning methods, covering both supervised and unsupervised learning regimes. Along with the benchmarks, we implement additional experiments, including physics-driven methods, complexity analysis, generalization study, uncertainty quantification, and so on, to sharpen our understanding of datasets and methods. The studies either provide valuable insights into the datasets and the performance, or uncover their current limitations. We hope OpenFWI supports prospective research on FWI and inspires future open-source efforts on AI for science.

A recent advance in falsification is to encode property satisfaction as a cost function based on a finite parameterization of the (bounded-time) input signal, which allows formulating bug-finding as an optimization problem. In this paper, we present a falsification technique that uses a local search technique called Tabu search to search for optimal inputs. The key idea is to discretize the space of input signals and use the Tabu list to avoid revisiting previously encountered input signals. As local search techniques may converge to local optima, we introduce stochastic aspects such as random restarts, sampling and probabilistically picking suboptimal inputs to guide the technique towards a global optimum. Picking the right parameterization of the input space is often challenging for designers, so we allow dynamic refinement of the input space as the search progresses. We implement the technique in a tool called sitar, and show scalability of the technique by using it to falsify requirements on an early prototype of an industrial-sized automotive powertrain control design.},

We then train the generative model as an agent (or a generator) to search the risky scenario parameters for a given driving algorithm. We treat the driving algorithm as an environment that returns high reward to the agent when a risky scenario is generated. The whole process is optimized by the policy gradient reinforcement learning method. Through the experiments conducted on several scenarios in the simulation, we demonstrate that the proposed framework generates safety-critical scenarios more efficiently than grid search or human design methods. Another advantage of this method is its adaptiveness to the routes and parameters.},

Also, the distribution of safety-critical data is usually multimodal, while most traditional attacks and evaluation methods focus on a single modality. To solve the above challenges, we propose a flow-based multimodal safety-critical scenario generator for evaluating decision-making algorithms. The proposed generative model is optimized with weighted likelihood maximization and a gradient-based sampling procedure is integrated to improve the sampling efficiency. The safety-critical scenarios are generated by efficiently querying the task algorithms and a simulator. Experiments on a self-driving task demonstrate our advantages in terms of testing efficiency and multimodal modeling capability.

One critical challenge for their massive deployment in the real world is their safety evaluation. Most existing driving systems are still trained and evaluated on naturalistic scenarios collected from daily life or heuristically-generated adversarial ones. However, the large population of cars, in general, leads to an extremely low collision rate, indicating that the safety-critical scenarios are rare in the collected real-world data. Thus, methods to artificially generate scenarios become crucial to measure the risk and reduce the cost. In this survey, we focus on the algorithms of safety-critical scenario generation in autonomous driving. We first provide a comprehensive taxonomy of existing algorithms by dividing them into three categories: data-driven generation, adversarial generation, and knowledge-based generation. Then, we discuss useful tools for scenario generation, including simulation platforms and packages. Finally, we extend our discussion to five main challenges of current works -- fidelity, efficiency, diversity, transferability, controllability -- and research opportunities lighted up by these challenges.},

Unfortunately, naive deep learning approaches typically cannot enforce the hard constraints of such problems, leading to infeasible solutions. In this work, we present Deep Constraint Completion and Correction (DC3), an algorithm to address this challenge. Specifically, this method enforces feasibility via a differentiable procedure, which implicitly completes partial solutions to satisfy equality constraints and unrolls gradient-based corrections to satisfy inequality constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of DC3 in both synthetic optimization tasks and the real-world setting of AC optimal power flow, where hard constraints encode the physics of the electrical grid. In both cases, DC3 achieves near-optimal objective values while preserving feasibility.},

In this paper, we focus on the design of our mobile systems. We highlight the challenges pertaining the design of those systems and offer recommendations that may support improved future designs and wider adoption of robotics in the architecture, engineering, and the construction industry. Overall, if we are to address applications in the building construction, we need first to overcome current limitations of industrial-oriented robotic systems. This implies higher flexibility and rapid adaptation to varied tasks performed potentially under volatile environmental conditions. Our work aims to create building blocks and case studies, including hardware and software components, towards a new way of end-production which will sooner than later transform the way we think and produce architectural design.},

The dependence on the dimension of the state space of the obtained bounds is studied to demonstrate the applicability of this method in the high dimensional setting. The convergence of an appropriately weighted empirical measure is also investigated and bounds for the mean square error and exponential deviation inequality for Lipschitz functions are reported.

Recent work has shown that these attacks generalize to the physical domain, to create perturbations on physical objects that fool image classifiers under a variety of real-world conditions. Such attacks pose a risk to deep learning models used in safety-critical cyber-physical systems. In this work, we extend physical attacks to more challenging object detection models, a broader class of deep learning algorithms widely used to detect and label multiple objects within a scene. Improving upon a previous physical attack on image classifiers, we create perturbed physical objects that are either ignored or mislabeled by object detection models. We implement a Disappearance Attack, in which we cause a Stop sign to "disappear" according to the detector--either by covering the sign with an adversarial Stop sign poster, or by adding adversarial stickers onto the sign. In a video recorded in a controlled lab environment, the state-of-the-art YOLO v2 detector failed to recognize these adversarial Stop signs in over 85\% of the video frames. In an outdoor experiment, YOLO was fooled by the poster and sticker attacks in 72.5\% and 63.5\% of the video frames respectively. We also use Faster R-CNN, a different object detection model, to demonstrate the transferability of our adversarial perturbations. The created poster perturbation is able to fool Faster R-CNN in 85.9\% of the video frames in a controlled lab environment, and 40.2\% of the video frames in an outdoor environment. Finally, we present preliminary results with a new Creation Attack, wherein innocuous physical stickers fool a model into detecting nonexistent objects.},

Simpler dynamics lead to faster convergence and to fewer discretizations of the solver, considerably decreasing wall-clock time without loss in performance. Our approach allows us to train neural ODE-based generative models to the same performance as the unregularized dynamics, with significant reductions in training time. This brings neural ODEs closer to practical relevance in large-scale applications.},

In response to a RANSAC requirement, new results are derived on the minimum number of landmarks needed to obtain a solution, and algorithms are presented for computing these minimum-landmark solutions in closed form.

Concretely, we introduce abstract transformers that capture the behavior of fully connected and convolutional neural network layers with rectified linear unit activations (ReLU), as well as max pooling layers. This allows us to handle real-world neural networks, which are often built out of those types of layers. We present a complete implementation of AI2 together with an extensive evaluation on 20 neural networks. Our results demonstrate that: (i) AI2 is precise enough to prove useful specifications (e.g., robustness), (ii) AI2 can be used to certify the effectiveness of state-of-the-art defenses for neural networks, (iii) AI2 is significantly faster than existing analyzers based on symbolic analysis, which often take hours to verify simple fully connected networks, and (iv) AI2 can handle deep convolutional networks, which are beyond the reach of existing methods.},

  abstract = {Despite a few notable uses of simulation of random processes in the pre-computer era (Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964, Section 1.2; Stigler, 2002, Chapter 7), practical widespread use of simulation had to await the invention of computers. Almost as soon as computers were invented, they were used for simulation (Hammersley and Handscomb, 1964, Section 1.2). The name ``Monte Carlo'' started as cuteness-gambling was then (around 1950) illegal in most places, and the casino at Monte Carlo was the most famous in the world-but it soon became a colorless technical term for simulation of random processes. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) was invented soon after ordinary Monte Carlo atLos Alamos, one of the few places where computers were available at the time. Metropolis et al. (1953){$\ast$} simulated a liquid in equilibrium with its gas phase. The obvious way to find out about the thermodynamic equilibrium is to simulate the dynamics of the system, and let it run until it reaches equilibrium. The tour de force was their realization that they did not need to simulate the exact dynamics; they only needed to simulate someMarkov chain having the same equilibrium distribution. Simulations following the scheme of Metropolis et al. (1953) are said to use the Metropolis algorithm. As computers became more widely available, the Metropolis algorithm was widely used by chemists and physicists, but it did not become widely known among statisticians until after 1990. Hastings (1970) generalized the Metropolis algorithm, and simulations following his scheme are said to use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. A special case of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm was introduced by Geman and Geman (1984), apparently without knowledge of earlier work. Simulations following their scheme are said to use the Gibbs sampler. Much of Geman and Geman (1984) discusses optimization to find the posterior mode rather than simulation, and it took some time for it to be understood in the spatial statistics community that the Gibbs sampler simulated the posterior distribution, thus enabling full Bayesian inference of all kinds. Amethodology that was later seen to be very similar to the Gibbs sampler was introduced by Tanner and Wong (1987), again apparently without knowledge of earlier work. To this day, some refer to the Gibbs sampler as ``data augmentation'' following these authors. Gelfand and Smith (1990)made thewider Bayesian community aware of theGibbs sampler, which up to that time had been known only in the spatial statistics community. Then it took off; as of this writing, a search for Gelfand and Smith (1990) on Google Scholar yields 4003 links to other works. It was rapidly realized that most Bayesian inference couldresearchers to properly understand the theory of MCMC (Geyer, 1992; Tierney, 1994) and that all of the aforementionedworkwas a special case of the notion ofMCMC.

  abstract = {We consider the problem of generating maximally adversarial disturbances for a given controller assuming only blackbox access to it. We propose an online learning approach to this problem that adaptively generates disturbances based on control inputs chosen by the controller. The goal of the disturbance generator is to minimize regret versus a benchmark disturbance-generating policy class, i.e., to maximize the cost incurred by the controller as well as possible compared to the best possible disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a benchmark policy class). In the setting where the dynamics are linear and the costs are quadratic, we formulate our problem as an online trust region (OTR) problem with memory and present a new online learning algorithm (MOTR) for this problem. We prove that this method competes with the best disturbance generator in hindsight (chosen from a rich class of benchmark policies that includes linear-dynamical disturbance generating policies). We demonstrate our approach on two simulated examples: (i) synthetically generated linear systems, and (ii) generating wind disturbances for the popular PX4 controller in the AirSim simulator. On these examples, we demonstrate that our approach outperforms several baseline approaches (including H-infinity disturbance generation and gradient-based methods).},

Early attempts at explaining this phenomenon focused on nonlinearity and overfitting. We argue instead that the primary cause of neural networks' vulnerability to adversarial perturbation is their linear nature. This explanation is supported by new quantitative results while giving the first explanation of the most intriguing fact about them: their generalization across architectures and training sets. Moreover, this view yields a simple and fast method of generating adversarial examples. Using this approach to provide examples for adversarial training, we reduce the test set error of a maxout network on the MNIST dataset.},

  abstract = {The goal of geophysical inversion is to make quantitative inferences about the Earth from remote observations. Because the observations are finite in number and subject to uncertainty, these inferences are inherently probabilistic. A key step is to define what it means for an Earth model to fit the data. This requires estimation of the uncertainties in the data, both those due to random noise and those due to theoretical errors. But the set of models that fit the data usually contains unrealistic models; i.e., models that violate our a priori prejudices, other data, or theoretical considerations. One strategy for eliminating such unreasonable models is to define an a priori probability density on the space of models, then use Bayes theorem to combine this probability with the data misfit function into a final a posteriori probability density reflecting both data fit and model reasonableness. We show here a case study of the application of the Bayesian strategy to inversion of surface seismic field data. Assuming that all uncertainties can be described by multidimensional Gaussian probability densities, we incorporate into the calculation information about ambient noise, discretization errors, theoretical errors, and a priori information about the set of layered Earth models derived from in situ petrophysical measurements. The result is a probability density on the space of models that takes into account all of this information. Inferences on model parameters can be derived by integration of this function. We begin by estimating the parameters of the Gaussian probability densities assumed to describe the data and model uncertainties. These are combined via Bayes theorem. The a posteriori probability is then optimized via a nonlinear conjugate gradient procedure to find the maximum a posteriori model. Uncertainty analysis is performed by making a Gaussian approximation of the a posteriori distribution about this peak model. We present the results of this analysis in three different forms: the maximum a posteriori model bracketed by one standard deviation error bars, pseudo-random simulations of the a posteriori probability (showing the range of typical subsurface models), and marginals of this probability at selected depths in the subsurface. The models we compute are consistent both with the surface seismic data and the borehole measurements, even though the latter are well below the resolution of the former. We also contrast the Bayesian maximum a posteriori model with the Occam model, which is the smoothest model that fits the surface seismic data alone.},

In this paper, we use Hutchinson's trace estimator to give a scalable unbiased estimate of the log-density. The result is a continuous-time invertible generative model with unbiased density estimation and one-pass sampling, while allowing unrestricted neural network architectures.

The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available. Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS. We apply our two-sample tests to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly. Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

Hand-tuned scenarios are typically added during simulation to induce safety-critical situations. An alternative approach is to adversarially perturb the background traffic trajectories. In this paper, we study this approach to safety-critical driving scenario generation using the CARLA simulator. We use a kinematic bicycle model as a proxy to the simulator's true dynamics and observe that gradients through this proxy model are sufficient for optimizing the background traffic trajectories. Based on this finding, we propose KING, which generates safety-critical driving scenarios with a 20\% higher success rate than black-box optimization. By solving the scenarios generated by KING using a privileged rule-based expert algorithm, we obtain training data for an imitation learning policy. After fine-tuning on this new data, we show that the policy becomes better at avoiding collisions. Importantly, our generated data leads to reduced collisions on both held-out scenarios generated via KING as well as traditional hand-crafted scenarios, demonstrating improved robustness.},

We characterize a family of non-convex functions for which this algorithm provably converges to a global optimum. In particular, we prove that the algorithm converges to an {$\varepsilon$}-approximate solution within O(1 / {$\varepsilon$}\^{}2) gradient-based steps. We extend our algorithm and analysis to the setting of stochastic non-convex optimization with noisy gradient feedback, attaining the same convergence rate. Additionally, we discuss the setting of ``zero-order optimization", and devise a variant of our algorithm which converges at rate of O(d\^{}2/ {$\varepsilon$}\^{}4).},

  abstract = {To accurately reproduce measurements from the real world, simulators need to have an adequate model of the physical system and require the parameters of the model be identified. We address the latter problem of estimating parameters through a Bayesian inference approach that approximates a posterior distribution over simulation parameters given real sensor measurements. By extending the commonly used Gaussian likelihood model for trajectories via the multiple-shooting formulation, our chosen particle-based inference algorithm Stein Variational Gradient Descent is able to identify highly nonlinear, underactuated systems. We leverage GPU code generation and differentiable simulation to evaluate the likelihood and its gradient for many particles in parallel. Our algorithm infers non-parametric distributions over simulation parameters more accurately than comparable baselines and handles constraints over parameters efficiently through gradient-based optimization. We evaluate estimation performance on several physical experiments. On an underactuated mechanism where a 7-DOF robot arm excites an object with an unknown mass configuration, we demonstrate how our inference technique can identify symmetries between the parameters and provide highly accurate predictions.

This enables anomaly detectors to generalize and detect unseen anomalies. In extensive experiments on natural language processing and small- and large-scale vision tasks, we find that Outlier Exposure significantly improves detection performance. We also observe that cutting-edge generative models trained on CIFAR-10 may assign higher likelihoods to SVHN images than to CIFAR-10 images; we use OE to mitigate this issue. We also analyze the flexibility and robustness of Outlier Exposure, and identify characteristics of the auxiliary dataset that improve performance.},

To effectively solve the tri-level optimization, the entire problem is formulated as two problems using Benders' decomposition: master problem with expansion planning and the sub-problem with the worst case load shedding. The sub-problem is a bi-level optimization problem which can be solved mathematically using strong duality theory and linearization method. CGTEP with the tri-level optimization can endure the disturbances of interval load and N-K contingencies. A benchmark test system is simulated to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, for Bender's decomposition with many sub-problems of worst load shedding, the numerically comparable results of a special case demonstrate that all sub-problems of composite contingencies must be validated at each iteration even if certain contingency meets the standard of load shedding at the previous iteration.},

Because of their high degree of motion freedom, these tools are able to assemble complex structures with irregular designs, which advances architectural aesthetics and structural performance. However, automated task and motion planning (TAMP) for a robot to assemble non-repetitive objects can be challenging due to (1) a non-repetitive assembly pattern (2) the need for a continuous robotic motion throughout a sequence of movement (3) a congested construction scene and (4) occasional robot configuration constraints due to taught positions. Recent work has already begun to address these challenges for repetitive assembly processes, where the robot repeats a pattern of primitive behaviors (e.g. brick stacking or spatial extrusion). Yet, there are many assembly processes that can benefit from a non-repetitive pattern. For example, processes can change tools on an element-by-element level to accommodate a wider range of geometry. Our work is motivated by the necessity of robotic modeling and planning for a recently published timber assembly process which utilizes distributed robotic clamps to press together interlocking joints. In addition to pick-And-place operations, the robot needs to move numerous tools within the construction scene, similar to a tool-change operation. In order to facilitate an agile process for architectural design, construction process design, and TAMP, we introduce a flowchart-based specification language which allows various designers to describe their design and construction intent and knowledge. A compiler can then translate the assembly description, sequence, process flowchart, and robotic setup into a plan skeleton. Additionally, we present a linear and a non-linear solving algorithm that can solve the plan skeleton for a full sequence of robot motions. This algorithm can be customized to take into account designer intuition, which can speed up the planning process. We provide a comparison of the two algorithms using the timber assembly process as our case study. We validate our results by robotically executing and constructing a large-scale real-world timber structure. Finally, we demonstrate the flexibility of our flowchart by showing how custom assembly actions are modeled in our case study. We also demonstrate how other recently published robotic assembly processes can be formulated using our flowcharts to demonstrate generalizability.},

  abstract = {Additive robotic construction of building-scale discrete bar structures, such as trusses and space frames, is increasingly attractive due to the potential improvements in efficiency, safety, and design possibilities. However, programming complex robots, such as manipulators with seven degrees of freedom, to successfully complete construction tasks can be tedious, challenging, or impossible for a human to do manually. Namely, the structure must be constructed in a sequence that preserves structural properties, such as stiffness, at each step. At the same time, this sequence must allow for the robot to precisely manipulate elements within the in-progress structure while respecting geometric constraints that, for example, ensure the robot does not collide with what it has built. In this work, we present an automated and newly generalized planning approach for jointly finding a construction sequence and robot motion plan for additive construction that satisfies these requirements. Our approach can be applied in a variety of additive construction processes, and we demonstrate it specifically on spatial extrusion and discrete bar assembly in this paper. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several simulated and real-world extrusion and assembly tasks, including a human-scale physical prototype, for which our algorithm is deployed for the first time to plan the assembly of a complicated double tangent bar system design.},

A light-weight tape is used to record the whole simulation program structure and replay the gradient kernels in a reversed order, for end-to-end backpropagation. We demonstrate the performance and productivity of our language in gradient-based learning and optimization tasks on 10 different physical simulators. For example, a differentiable elastic object simulator written in our language is 4.2x shorter than the hand-engineered CUDA version yet runs as fast, and is 188x faster than the TensorFlow implementation.

We propose a framework for training supervised latent Dirichlet allocation that balances two goals: faithful generative explanations of high-dimensional data and accurate prediction of associated class labels. Existing approaches fail to balance these goals by not properly handling a fundamental asymmetry: the intended application is always predicting labels from data, not data from labels. Our new prediction-constrained objective for training generative models coherently integrates supervisory signals even when only a small fraction of training examples are labeled. We demonstrate improved prediction quality compared to previous supervised topic models, achieving results competitive with high-dimensional logistic regression on text analysis and electronic health records tasks while simultaneously learning interpretable topics.},

  abstract = {The model-based methods have recently found widespread applications in solving hard nondifferentiable optimization problems. These algorithms are population-based and typically require hundreds of candidate solutions to be sampled at each iteration. In addition, recent convergence analysis of these algorithms also stipulates a sample size that increases polynomially with the number of iterations. In this article, we aim to improve the efficiency of model-based algorithms by reducing the number of candidate solutions generated per iteration. This is carried out through embedding a stochastic averaging procedure within these methods to make more efficient use of the past sampling information. This procedure not only can potentially reduce the number of function evaluations needed to obtain high-quality solutions, but also makes the underlying algorithms more amenable for parallel computation. The detailed implementation of our approach is demonstrated through an exemplary algorithm instantiation called Model-based Annealing Random Search with Stochastic Averaging (MARS-SA), which maintains the per iteration sample size at a small constant value. We establish the global convergence property of MARS-SA and provide numerical examples to illustrate its performance.},

  abstract = {The Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) was introduced by Evensen in 1994 [10] as a novel method for data assimilation: state estimation for noisily observed time-dependent problems. Since that time it has had enormous impact in many application domains because of its robustness and ease of implementation, and numerical evidence of its accuracy. In this paper we propose the application of an iterative ensemble Kalman method for the solution of a wide class of inverse problems. In this context we show that the estimate of the unknown function that we obtain with the ensemble Kalman method lies in a subspace A spanned by the initial ensemble. Hence the resulting error may be bounded above by the error found from the best approximation in this subspace. We provide numerical experiments which compare the error incurred by the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems with the error of the best approximation in A, and with variants on traditional least-squares approaches, restricted to the subspace A. In so doing we demonstrate that the the ensemble Kalman method for inverse problems provides a derivative-free optimization method with comparable accuracy to that achieved by traditional least-squares approaches. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that the accuracy is of the same order of magnitude as that achieved by the best approximation. Three examples are used to demonstrate these assertions: inversion of a compact linear operator; inversion of piezometric head to determine hydraulic conductivity in a Darcy model of groundwater flow; and inversion of Eulerian velocity measurements at positive times to determine the initial condition in an incompressible fluid.},

Secondly, for a reasonably accurate perception system, encountering a rare failure trajectory may require running infeasibly many simulations. This paper combines perception error models -- surrogates for a sensor-based detection system -- with state-dependent adaptive importance sampling. This allows us to efficiently assess the rare failure probabilities for real-world perceptual control systems within simulation. Our experiments with an autonomous braking system equipped with an RGB obstacle-detector show that our method can calculate accurate failure probabilities with an inexpensive number of simulations. Further, we show how choice of safety metric can influence the process of learning proposal distributions capable of reliably sampling high-probability failures.},

In this work, we present ORCHID (Optimisation of Robotic Control and Hardware In Design) which allows for truly simultaneous optimisation of hardware and control parameters in an RL pipeline. We show that by forming a complex differential path through a trajectory rollout we can leverage a vast amount of information from the system that was previously lost in the 'black-box' environment. Combining this with a novel hardware-conditioned critic network minimises variance during training and ensures stable updates are made. This allows for refinements to be made to both the morphology and control parameters simultaneously. The result is an efficient and versatile approach to holistic robot design, that brings the final system nearer to true optimality. We show improvements in performance across 4 different test environments with two different control algorithms-in all experiments the maximum performance achieved with ORCHID is shown to be unattainable using only policy updates with the default design. We also show how redesigning a robot using ORCHID in simulation, transfers to a vast improvement in the performance of a real-world robot.},

In this paper, we show how differentiable rendering can be utilized to generate images that are informative, yet realistic, and which can be used to analyze DNN performance and improve its robustness through data augmentation. Given a differentiable renderer and a DNN, we show how to use off-the-shelf attacks from adversarial machine learning to generate semantic counterexamples -- images where semantic features are changed as to produce misclassifications or misdetections. We validate our approach on DNNs for image classification and object detection. For classification, we show that semantic counterexamples, when used to augment the dataset, (i) improve generalization performance (ii) enhance robustness to semantic transformations, and (iii) transfer between models. Additionally, in comparison to sampling-based semantic augmentation, our technique generates more informative data in a sample efficient manner.},

Recent approaches automatically generate a reward function from a given specification and use a suitable reinforcement learning algorithm to learn a policy that maximizes the expected reward. These approaches, however, scale poorly to complex tasks that require high-level planning. In this work, we develop a compositional learning approach, called DIRL, that interleaves high-level planning and reinforcement learning. First, DIRL encodes the specification as an abstract graph; intuitively, vertices and edges of the graph correspond to regions of the state space and simpler sub-tasks, respectively. Our approach then incorporates reinforcement learning to learn neural network policies for each edge (sub-task) within a Dijkstra-style planning algorithm to compute a high-level plan in the graph. An evaluation of the proposed approach on a set of challenging control benchmarks with continuous state and action spaces demonstrates that it outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.},

Then, guided by the structure of the specifications , our algorithm searches over policies to identify one that provably forms an-Nash equilibrium (with high probability). Importantly, it prioritizes policies in a way that maximizes social welfare across all agents. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that our algorithm computes equilibrium policies with high social welfare, whereas state-of-the-art baselines either fail to compute Nash equilibria or compute ones with comparatively lower social welfare.},

  abstract = {We present a dataset of several fault types in control surfaces of a fixed-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for use in fault detection and isolation (FDI) and anomaly detection (AD) research. Currently, the dataset includes processed data for 47 autonomous flights with 23 sudden full engine failure scenarios and 24 scenarios for 7 other types of sudden control surface (actuator) faults, with a total of 66 minutes of flight under normal conditions and 13 minutes of post-fault flight time. It additionally includes many hours of raw data of fully autonomous, autopilot-assisted and manual flights with tens of fault scenarios. The ground truth of the time and type of faults is provided in each scenario to enable evaluation of the methods using the dataset. We have also provided the helper tools in several programming languages to load and work with the data and to help the evaluation of a detection method using the dataset. A set of metrics is proposed to help to compare different methods using the dataset. Most of the current fault detection methods are evaluated in simulation and, as far as we know, this dataset is the only one providing the real flight data with faults in such capacity. We hope it will help advance the state of the art in AD or FDI research for autonomous aerial vehicles and mobile robots to enhance the safety of autonomous and remote flight operations further.

The maximum exponential rate of growth of the gambler's capital is equal to the rate of transmission of information over the channel. This result is generalized to include the case of arbitrary odds. Thus we find a situation in which the transmission rate is significant even though no coding is contemplated. Previously this quantity was given significance only by a theorem of Shannon's which asserted that, with suitable encoding, binary digits could be transmitted over the channel at this rate with an arbitrarily small probability of error.},

  abstract = {The conjoining of dynamical systems and deep learning has become a topic of great interest. In particular, neural differential equations (NDEs) demonstrate that neural networks and differential equation are two sides of the same coin. Traditional parameterised differential equations are a special case. Many popular neural network architectures, such as residual networks and recurrent networks, are discretisations. NDEs are suitable for tackling generative problems, dynamical systems, and time series (particularly in physics, finance, ...) and are thus of interest to both modern machine learning and traditional mathematical modelling. NDEs offer high-capacity function approximation, strong priors on model space, the ability to handle irregular data, memory efficiency, and a wealth of available theory on both sides. This doctoral thesis provides an in-depth survey of the field. Topics include: neural ordinary differential equations (e.g. for hybrid neural/mechanistic modelling of physical systems); neural controlled differential equations (e.g. for learning functions of irregular time series); and neural stochastic differential equations (e.g. to produce generative models capable of representing complex stochastic dynamics, or sampling from complex high-dimensional distributions). Further topics include: numerical methods for NDEs (e.g. reversible differential equations solvers, backpropagation through differential equations, Brownian reconstruction); symbolic regression for dynamical systems (e.g. via regularised evolution); and deep implicit models (e.g. deep equilibrium models, differentiable optimisation). We anticipate this thesis will be of interest to anyone interested in the marriage of deep learning with dynamical systems, and hope it will provide a useful reference for the current state of the art.},

Normalizing flows are flexible deep generative models that often surprisingly fail to distinguish between in- and out-of-distribution data: a flow trained on pictures of clothing assigns higher likelihood to handwritten digits. We investigate why normalizing flows perform poorly for OOD detection. We demonstrate that flows learn local pixel correlations and generic image-to-latent-space transformations which are not specific to the target image datasets, focusing on flows based on coupling layers. We show that by modifying the architecture of flow coupling layers we can bias the flow towards learning the semantic structure of the target data, improving OOD detection. Our investigation reveals that properties that enable flows to generate high-fidelity images can have a detrimental effect on OOD detection.},

To find a domain in which a learned control-affine approximation of the true dynamics can be trusted, we estimate the Lipschitz constant of the difference between the true and learned dynamics, and ensure the estimate is valid with a given probability. Provided the system has at least as many controls as states, we also derive existence conditions for a one-step feedback law which can keep the real system within a small bound of a nominal trajectory planned with the learned dynamics. Our method imposes the feedback law existence as a constraint in a sampling-based planner, which returns a feedback policy around a nominal plan ensuring that, if the Lipschitz constant estimate is valid, the true system is safe during plan execution, reaches the goal, and is ultimately invariant in a small set about the goal. We demonstrate our approach by planning using learned models of a 6D quadrotor and a 7DOF Kuka arm. We show that a baseline which plans using the same learned dynamics without considering the error bound or the existence of the feedback law can fail to stabilize around the plan and become unsafe.},

Adaptive Stress Testing (AST) provides a way to search for the most-likely failure scenario as a Markov decision process (MDP). Our previous work used a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) solver to identify likely failure scenarios. However, the solver's use of a feed-forward neural network with a discretized space of possible initial conditions poses two major problems. First, the system is not treated as a black box, in that it requires analyzing the internal state of the system, which leads to considerable implementation complexities. Second, in order to simulate realistic settings, a new instance of the solver needs to be run for each initial condition. Running a new solver for each initial condition not only significantly increases the computational complexity, but also disregards the underlying relationship between similar initial conditions. We provide a solution to both problems by employing a recurrent neural network that takes a set of initial conditions from a continuous space as input. This approach enables robust and efficient detection of failures because the solution generalizes across the entire space of initial conditions. By simulating an instance where an autonomous car drives while a pedestrian is crossing a road, we demonstrate the solver is now capable of finding solutions for problems that would have previously been intractable.},

Formal methods are mathematical techniques for reasoning about systems, their requirements, and their guarantees. Formal synthesis for robotics refers to frameworks for specifying tasks in a mathematically precise language and automatically transforming these specifications into correct-by-construction robot controllers or into a proof that the task cannot be done. Synthesis allows users to reason about the task specification rather than its implementation, reduces implementation error, and provides behavioral guarantees for the resulting controller. This article reviews the current state of formal synthesis for robotics and surveys the landscape of abstractions, specifications, and synthesis algorithms that enable it.},

  abstract = {Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.}

Our improvement increases the scope of the estimator from differentiable models to non-differentiable ones without requiring manual intervention of the user; the improved estimator automatically identifies differentiable parts of a given probabilistic program using our static analysis, and applies the pathwise gradient estimator to the identified parts while using a more general but less efficient estimator, called score estimator, for the rest of the program. Our analysis has a surprisingly subtle soundness argument, partly due to the misbehaviours of some target smoothness properties when viewed from the perspective of program analysis designers. For instance, some smoothness properties are not preserved by function composition, and this makes it difficult to analyse sequential composition soundly without heavily sacrificing precision. We formulate five assumptions on a target smoothness property, prove the soundness of our analysis under those assumptions, and show that our leading examples satisfy these assumptions. We also show that by using information from our analysis, our improved gradient estimator satisfies an important differentiability requirement and thus, under a mild regularity condition, computes the correct estimate on average, i.e., it returns an unbiased estimate. Our experiments with representative probabilistic programs in the Pyro language show that our static analysis is capable of identifying smooth parts of those programs accurately, and making our improved pathwise gradient estimator exploit all the opportunities for high performance in those programs.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming is the idea of writing models from statistics and machine learning using program notations and reasoning about these models using generic inference engines. Recently its combination with deep learning has been explored intensely, which led to the development of so called deep probabilistic programming languages, such as Pyro, Edward and ProbTorch. At the core of this development lie inference engines based on stochastic variational inference algorithms. When asked to find information about the posterior distribution of a model written in such a language, these algorithms convert this posterior-inference query into an optimisation problem and solve it approximately by a form of gradient ascent or descent. In this paper, we analyse one of the most fundamental and versatile variational inference algorithms, called score estimator or REINFORCE, using tools from denotational semantics and program analysis. We formally express what this algorithm does on models denoted by programs, and expose implicit assumptions made by the algorithm on the models. The violation of these assumptions may lead to an undefined optimisation objective or the loss of convergence guarantee of the optimisation process. We then describe rules for proving these assumptions, which can be automated by static program analyses. Some of our rules use nontrivial facts from continuous mathematics, and let us replace requirements about integrals in the assumptions, such as integrability of functions defined in terms of programs' denotations, by conditions involving differentiation or boundedness, which are much easier to prove automatically (and manually). Following our general methodology, we have developed a static program analysis for the Pyro programming language that aims at discharging the assumption about what we call model-guide support match. Our analysis is applied to the eight representative model-guide pairs from the Pyro webpage, which include sophisticated neural network models such as AIR. It finds a bug in one of these cases, reveals a non-standard use of an inference engine in another, and shows that the assumptions are met in the remaining six cases.},

  abstract = {Reasoning about 3D scenes from their 2D image projections is one of the core problems in computer vision. Solutions to this inverse and ill-posed problem typically involve a search for models that best explain observed image data. Notably, images depend both on the properties of observed scenes and on the process of image formation. Hence, if optimization techniques should be used to explain images, it is crucial to design differentable functions for the projection of 3D scenes into images, also known as differentiable rendering. Previous approaches to differentiable rendering typically replace non-differentiable operations by smooth approximations, impacting the subsequent 3D estimation. In this paper, we take a more general approach and study differentiable renderers through the prism of randomized optimization and the related notion of perturbed optimizers. In particular, our work highlights the link between some well-known differentiable renderer formulations and randomly smoothed optimizers, and introduces differentiable perturbed renderers. We also propose a variance reduction mechanism to alleviate the computational burden inherent to perturbed optimizers and introduce an adaptive scheme to automatically adjust the smoothing parameters of the rendering process. We apply our method to 3D scene reconstruction and demonstrate its advantages on the tasks of 6D pose estimation and 3D mesh reconstruction. By providing informative gradients that can be used as a strong supervisory signal, we demonstrate the benefits of perturbed renderers to obtain more accurate solutions when compared to the state-of-the-art alternatives using smooth gradient approximations.},

Specifically, STL is a powerful and expressive formal language that can specify spatial and temporal properties of signals generated by both continuous and hybrid systems. The quantitative semantics of STL provide a robustness metric, i.e., how much a signal satisfies or violates an STL specification. In this work, we devise a systematic methodology for translating STL robustness formulas into computation graphs. With this representation, and by leveraging off-the-shelf automatic differentiation tools, we are able to back-propagate through STL robustness formulas and hence enable a natural and easy-to-use integration with many gradient-based approaches used in robotics. We demonstrate, through examples stemming from various robotics applications, that stlcg is versatile, computationally efficient, and capable of injecting human-domain knowledge into the problem formulation.},

  abstract = {The framework of reinforcement learning or optimal control provides a mathematical formalization of intelligent decision making that is powerful and broadly applicable. While the general form of the reinforcement learning problem enables effective reasoning about uncertainty, the connection between reinforcement learning and inference in probabilistic models is not immediately obvious. However, such a connection has considerable value when it comes to algorithm design: formalizing a problem as probabilistic inference in principle allows us to bring to bear a wide array of approximate inference tools, extend the model in flexible and powerful ways, and reason about compositionality and partial observability. In this article, we will discuss how a generalization of the reinforcement learning or optimal control problem, which is sometimes termed maximum entropy reinforcement learning, is equivalent to exact probabilistic inference in the case of deterministic dynamics, and variational inference in the case of stochastic dynamics. We will present a detailed derivation of this framework, overview prior work that has drawn on this and related ideas to propose new reinforcement learning and control algorithms, and describe perspectives on future research.},

  abstract = {When compared to the image classification models, black-box adversarial attacks against video classification models have been largely understudied. This could be possible because, with video, the temporal dimension poses significant additional challenges in gradient estimation. Query-efficient black-box attacks rely on effectively estimated gradients towards maximizing the probability of misclassifying the target video. In this work, we demonstrate that such effective gradients can be searched for by parameterizing the temporal structure of the search space with geometric transformations. Specifically, we design a novel iterative algorithm GEOmetric TRAnsformed Perturbations (GEO-TRAP), for attacking video classification models. GEO-TRAP employs standard geometric transformation operations to reduce the search space for effective gradients into searching for a small group of parameters that define these operations. This group of parameters describes the geometric progression of gradients, resulting in a reduced and structured search space. Our algorithm inherently leads to successful perturbations with surprisingly few queries. For example, adversarial examples generated from GEO-TRAP have better attack success rates with {\textasciitilde}73.55\% fewer queries compared to the state-of-the-art method for video adversarial attacks on the widely used Jester dataset. Overall, our algorithm exposes vulnerabilities of diverse video classification models and achieves new state-of-the-art results under black-box settings on two large datasets.},

We show in a series of experiments that ODIN is compatible with diverse network architectures and datasets. It consistently outperforms the baseline approach by a large margin, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance on this task.

The classical method for maximizing the likelihood of these models is the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. For problems with high-dimensional latent variables and large datasets, EM scales poorly because it needs to invert as many large covariance matrices as the number of data points. We introduce probabilistic unrolling, a method that combines Monte Carlo sampling with iterative linear solvers to circumvent matrix inversion. Our theoretical analyses reveal that unrolling and backpropagation through the iterations of the solver can accelerate gradient estimation for maximum likelihood estimation. In experiments on simulated and real data, we demonstrate that probabilistic unrolling learns latent Gaussian models up to an order of magnitude faster than gradient EM, with minimal losses in model performance.},

In this work, we are the first to conduct an extensive study of the transferability over large models and a large scale dataset, and we are also the first to study the transferability of targeted adversarial examples with their target labels. We study both non-targeted and targeted adversarial examples, and show that while transferable non-targeted adversarial examples are easy to find, targeted adversarial examples generated using existing approaches almost never transfer with their target labels. Therefore, we propose novel ensemble-based approaches to generating transferable adversarial examples. Using such approaches, we observe a large proportion of targeted adversarial examples that are able to transfer with their target labels for the first time. We also present some geometric studies to help understanding the transferable adversarial examples. Finally, we show that the adversarial examples generated using ensemble-based approaches can successfully attack Clarifai.com, which is a black-box image classification system.},

We provide a theoretical guarantee of the proposed algorithm and empirically validate it on different inverse problems.

Prior theoretical works on adversarial attacks against RL mainly focus on either reward poisoning attacks or environment poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new class of attacks named action poisoning attacks, where an adversary can change the action signal selected by the agent. Compared with existing attack models, the attacker's ability in the proposed action poisoning attack model is more restricted, which brings some design challenges. We study the action poisoning attack in both white-box and black-box settings. We introduce an adaptive attack scheme called LCB-H, which works for most RL agents in the black-box setting. We prove that LCB-H attack can force any efficient RL agent, whose dynamic regret scales sublinearly with the total number of steps taken, to choose actions according to a policy selected by the attacker very frequently, with only sublinear cost. In addition, we apply LCB-H attack against a very popular model-free RL algorithm: UCB-H. We show that, even in black-box setting, by spending only logarithm cost, the proposed LCB-H attack scheme can force the UCB-H agent to choose actions according to the policy selected by the attacker very frequently.},

Its principled nature also enables us to identify methods for both training and attacking neural networks that are reliable and, in a certain sense, universal. In particular, they specify a concrete security guarantee that would protect against a well-defined class of adversaries. These methods let us train networks with significantly improved resistance to a wide range of adversarial attacks. They also suggest robustness against a first-order adversary as a natural security guarantee.

Despite the wide acceptance of SOS programming in the control and optimization communities, scalability has been a key challenge due to its reliance on semidefinite programming (SDP) as its main computational engine. While SDPs have many appealing features, current SDP solvers do not approach the scalability or numerical maturity of LP and SOCP solvers. Our approach is based on the recent work of Ahmadi and Majumdar [1], which replaces the positive semidefiniteness constraint inherent in the SOS approach with stronger conditions based on diagonal dominance and scaled diagonal dominance. This leads to the DSOS and SDSOS cones of polynomials, which can be optimized over using LP and SOCP respectively. We demonstrate this approach on four high dimensional control problems that are currently well beyond the reach of SOS programming: computing a region of attraction for a 22 dimensional system, analysis of a 50 node network of oscillators, searching for degree 3 controllers and degree 8 Lyapunov functions for an Acrobot system (with the resulting controller validated on a hardware platform), and a balancing controller for a 30 state and 14 control input model of the ATLAS humanoid robot. While there is additional conservatism introduced by our approach, extensive numerical experiments on smaller instances of our problems demonstrate that this conservatism can be small compared to SOS programming.},

By replacing conventional optimization-based inference with a learned model, inference is amortized over data examples and therefore more computationally efficient. However, standard inference models are restricted to direct mappings from data to approximate posterior estimates. The failure of these models to reach fully optimized approximate posterior estimates results in an amortization gap. We aim toward closing this gap by proposing iterative inference models, which learn to perform inference optimization through repeatedly encoding gradients. Our approach generalizes standard inference models in VAEs and provides insight into several empirical findings, including top-down inference techniques. We demonstrate the inference optimization capabilities of iterative inference models and show that they outperform standard inference models on several benchmark data sets of images and text.},

Moreover, existing results have been obtained primarily in the setting of convex functions (for optimization) and log-concave functions (for sampling). In this setting, where local properties determine global properties, optimization algorithms are unsurprisingly more efficient computationally than sampling algorithms. We instead examine a class of nonconvex objective functions that arise in mixture modeling and multistable systems. In this nonconvex setting, we find that the computational complexity of sampling algorithms scales linearly with the model dimension while that of optimization algorithms scales exponentially.},

To tackle this limitation, we develop two new logical operators in SaSTL to augment STL for expressing spatial aggregation and spatial counting characteristics that are commonly found in real city requirements. We also develop efficient monitoring algorithms that can check a SaSTL requirement in parallel over multiple data streams (e.g., generated by multiple sensors distributed spatially in a city). We evaluate our SaSTL monitor by applying to two case studies with large-scale real city sensing data (e.g., up to 10,000 sensors in one requirement). The results show that SaSTL has a much higher coverage expressiveness than other spatialoral logics, and with a significant reduction of computation time for monitoring requirements. We also demonstrate that the SaSTL monitor can help improve the safety and performance of smart cities via simulated experiments.},

Hydrodynamic performances of the underwater robot are concerned about in the design, including the resistance and the manoeuvrability. A method of MDO, Collaborative Optimization (CO), is adopted. To improve the efficiency of optimization, approximate models are established in sub-disciplines. Also, an artificial intelligent technique, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), is incorporated into the CO framework. The optimization design of the lines of the underwater robot is carried out on an Isight platform, an automatic integration optimization platform. Through the platform, the optimization design of the lines and the analysis of the hydrodynamic performances can be achieved automatically with high efficiency. An autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV), SUBOFF, is taken as a verification model. For different lines, CFD calculation is performed to analyze the resistance and manoeuvrability. By comparison, the optimal lines of the hull and the fairwater are determined.},

However, current methods for training flows either suffer from mode-seeking behavior, use samples from the target generated beforehand by expensive MCMC methods, or use stochastic losses that have high variance. To avoid these problems, we augment flows with annealed importance sampling (AIS) and minimize the mass-covering \${\textbackslash}alpha\$-divergence with \${\textbackslash}alpha=2\$, which minimizes importance weight variance. Our method, Flow AIS Bootstrap (FAB), uses AIS to generate samples in regions where the flow is a poor approximation of the target, facilitating the discovery of new modes. We apply FAB to multimodal targets and show that we can approximate them very accurately where previous methods fail. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to learn the Boltzmann distribution of the alanine dipeptide molecule using only the unnormalized target density, without access to samples generated via Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations: FAB produces better results than training via maximum likelihood on MD samples while using 100 times fewer target evaluations. After reweighting the samples, we obtain unbiased histograms of dihedral angles that are almost identical to the ground truth.},

  abstract = {Accurately estimating the probability of failure for safety-critical systems is important for certification. Estimation is often challenging due to high-dimensional input spaces, dangerous test scenarios, and computationally expensive simulators; thus, efficient estimation techniques are important to study. This work reframes the problem of black-box safety validation as a Bayesian optimization problem and introduces an algorithm, Bayesian safety validation, that iteratively fits a probabilistic surrogate model to efficiently predict failures. The algorithm is designed to search for failures, compute the most-likely failure, and estimate the failure probability over an operating domain using importance sampling. We introduce a set of three acquisition functions that focus on reducing uncertainty by covering the design space, optimizing the analytically derived failure boundaries, and sampling the predicted failure regions. Mainly concerned with systems that only output a binary indication of failure, we show that our method also works well in cases where more output information is available. Results show that Bayesian safety validation achieves a better estimate of the probability of failure using orders of magnitude fewer samples and performs well across various safety validation metrics. We demonstrate the algorithm on three test problems with access to ground truth and on a real-world safety-critical subsystem common in autonomous flight: a neural network-based runway detection system. This work is open sourced and currently being used to supplement the FAA certification process of the machine learning components for an autonomous cargo aircraft.},

This unique combination enables backpropagation from pixels in a video sequence through to the underlying physical attributes that generated them. Furthermore, our unified computation graph across dynamics and rendering engines enables the learning of challenging visuomotor control tasks, without relying on state-based (3D) supervision, while obtaining performance competitive to/better than techniques that require precise 3D labels.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) originated with the classic paper of Metropolis et al. (1953), where it was used to simulate the distribution of states for a system of idealized molecules. Not long after, another approach tomolecular simulationwas introduced (Alder and Wainwright, 1959), in which the motion of the molecules was deterministic, following Newton's laws ofmotion,which have an elegant formalization asHamiltonian dynamics. For finding the properties of bulk materials, these approaches are asymptotically equivalent, since even in a deterministic simulation, each local region of the material experiences effectively random influences from distant regions. Despite the large overlap in their application areas, the MCMC and molecular dynamics approaches have continued to coexist in the following decades (see Frenkel and Smit, 1996). In 1987, a landmark paper by Duane, Kennedy, Pendleton, and Roweth united theMCMC and molecular dynamics approaches. They called their method ``hybrid Monte Carlo,'' which abbreviates to ``HMC,'' but the phrase ``Hamiltonian Monte Carlo,'' retaining the abbreviation, is more specific and descriptive, and I will use it here. Duane et al. applied HMC not to molecular simulation, but to lattice field theory simulations of quantum chromodynamics. Statistical applications of HMC began with my use of it for neural network models (Neal, 1996a). I also provided a statistically-oriented tutorial on HMC in a review of MCMC methods (Neal, 1993, Chapter 5). There have been other applications of HMC to statistical problems (e.g. Ishwaran, 1999; Schmidt, 2009) and statisticallyoriented reviews (e.g. Liu, 2001, Chapter 9), but HMC still seems to be underappreciated by statisticians, and perhaps also by physicists outside the lattice field theory community. This review begins by describing Hamiltonian dynamics. Despite terminology that maybe unfamiliar outside physics, the features of Hamiltonian dynamics that are needed for HMC are elementary. The differential equations of Hamiltonian dynamics must be discretized for computer implementation. The ``leapfrog'' scheme that is typically used is quite simple. Following this introduction to Hamiltonian dynamics, I describe how to use it to con-struct an MCMCmethod. The first step is to define a Hamiltonian function in terms of the probability distribution we wish to sample from. In addition to the variables we are interested in (the ``position'' variables), we must introduce auxiliary ``momentum'' variables, which typically have independent Gaussian distributions. The HMC method alternates simple updates for these momentum variables with Metropolis updates in which a new state is proposed by computing a trajectory according to Hamiltonian dynamics, implemented with the leapfrog method. A state proposed in this way can be distant from thethe exploration of the state space that occurs whenMetropolis updates are done using a simple random-walkproposal distribution. (Analternativewayof avoiding randomwalks is touse short trajectories but only partially replace the momentum variables between trajectories, so that successive trajectories tend to move in the same direction.) After presenting the basic HMCmethod, I discuss practical issues of tuning the leapfrogstepsize and number of leapfrog steps, as well as theoretical results on the scaling of HMC with dimensionality. I then present a number of variations on HMC. The acceptance rate for HMC can be increased for many problems by looking at ``windows'' of states at the beginning and end of the trajectory. For many statistical problems, approximate computation of trajectories (e.g. using subsets of the data) may be beneficial. Tuning of HMC can be made easier using a ``short-cut'' in which trajectories computed with a bad choice of stepsize take little computation time. Finally, ``tempering'' methods may be useful when multiple isolated modes exist.},

Jointly crafted adversarial inputs might be expected to synergistically manipulate a classifier, allowing for very strong data-poisoning attacks that would be hard to detect. We show that in a white box setting, these attacks are very successful and can cause the target model's predictions to become worse than chance. However, in opposition to the well-known transferability of adversarial examples in general, the colluding sets do not transfer well to different classifiers. We explore two hypotheses to explain this: 'overfitting' by the attack, and mismatch between the model on which the attack is generated and that to which the attack is transferred. Regardless of the mitigation strategies suggested by these hypotheses, the colluding inputs transfer no better than adversarial inputs that are generated independently in the usual way.},

  abstract = {A normalizing flow is an invertible mapping between an arbitrary probability distribution and a standard normal distribution; it can be used for density estimation and statistical inference. Computing the flow follows the change of variables formula and thus requires invertibility of the mapping and an efficient way to compute the determinant of its Jacobian. To satisfy these requirements, normalizing flows typically consist of carefully chosen components. Continuous normalizing flows (CNFs) are mappings obtained by solving a neural ordinary differential equation (ODE). The neural ODE's dynamics can be chosen almost arbitrarily while ensuring invertibility. Moreover, the log-determinant of the flow's Jacobian can be obtained by integrating the trace of the dynamics' Jacobian along the flow. Our proposed OT-Flow approach tackles two critical computational challenges that limit a more widespread use of CNFs. First, OT-Flow leverages optimal transport (OT) theory to regularize the CNF and enforce straight trajectories that are easier to integrate. Second, OT-Flow features exact trace computation with time complexity equal to trace estimators used in existing CNFs. On five high-dimensional density estimation and generative modeling tasks, OT-Flow performs competitively to state-of-the-art CNFs while on average requiring one-fourth of the number of weights with an 8x speedup in training time and 24x speedup in inference.},

In this work, we leverage the robustness degree metric on STL expressions---quantifying the degree to which an STL specification is satisfied by a signal--- and formulate an optimization problem that maximizes the robustness degree to generate control trajectories for the small satellite IMPRESS. We utilize the smooth approximation of robustness degree and use a gradient-based optimization framework to generate these control trajectories. The proposed approach is validated on simulated data for a mission scenario involving communication with ground stations and maintaining onboard power.},

In this paper, we present an approach to solve this problem for multi-quadrotor missions. Given a mission expressed in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), our controller maximizes robustness to generate trajectories for the quadrotors that satisfy the STL specification in continuous-time. We also show that the constraints on our optimization guarantees that these trajectories can be tracked nearly perfectly by lower level off-the-shelf position and attitude controllers. Our approach avoids the oversimplifying abstractions found in many planning methods, while retaining the expressiveness of missions encoded in STL allowing us to handle complex spatial, temporal and reactive requirements. Through experiments, both in simulation and on actual quadrotors, we show the performance, scalability and real-time applicability of our method.},

There has been much recent work on normalizing flows, ranging from improving their expressive power to expanding their application. We believe the field has now matured and is in need of a unified perspective. In this review, we attempt to provide such a perspective by describing flows through the lens of probabilistic modeling and inference. We place special emphasis on the fundamental principles of flow design, and discuss foundational topics such as expressive power and computational trade-offs. We also broaden the conceptual framing of flows by relating them to more general probability transformations. Lastly, we summarize the use of flows for tasks such as generative modeling, approximate inference, and supervised learning.},

Adversarial examples that affect one model often affect another model, even if the two models have different architectures or were trained on different training sets, so long as both models were trained to perform the same task. An attacker may therefore train their own substitute model, craft adversarial examples against the substitute, and transfer them to a victim model, with very little information about the victim. Recent work has further developed a technique that uses the victim model as an oracle to label a synthetic training set for the substitute, so the attacker need not even collect a training set to mount the attack. We extend these recent techniques using reservoir sampling to greatly enhance the efficiency of the training procedure for the substitute model. We introduce new transferability attacks between previously unexplored (substitute, victim) pairs of machine learning model classes, most notably SVMs and decision trees. We demonstrate our attacks on two commercial machine learning classification systems from Amazon (96.19\% misclassification rate) and Google (88.94\%) using only 800 queries of the victim model, thereby showing that existing machine learning approaches are in general vulnerable to systematic black-box attacks regardless of their structure.},

Common approaches have taken the form of meta-learning: learning to learn on the new problem given the old. Following the recognition that meta-learning is implementing learning in a multi-level model, we present a Bayesian treatment for the meta-learning inner loop through the use of deep kernels. As a result we can learn a kernel that transfers to new tasks; we call this Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT). This approach has many advantages: is straightforward to implement as a single optimizer, provides uncertainty quantification, and does not require estimation of task-specific parameters. We empirically demonstrate that DKT outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms in few-shot classification, and is the state of the art for cross-domain adaptation and regression. We conclude that complex meta-learning routines can be replaced by a simpler Bayesian model without loss of accuracy.},

The Approximate Network Delays (AND) model computes the delays due to local congestion at individual airports and captures the ``ripple effect'' that leads to the propagation of these delays. The model operates by iterating between its two main components: a queuing engine (QE) that computes delays at individual airports and a delay propagation algorithm (DPA) that updates flight schedules and demand rates at all the airports in the model in response to the local delays computed by the QE. The QE is a stochastic and dynamic queuing model that treats each airport in the network as a M(t)/Ek(t)/1 queuing system. The AND model is very fast computationally, thus making possible the exploration at a macroscopic level of the impacts of a large number of scenarios and policy alternatives on system-wide delays. It has been applied to a network consisting of the 34 busiest airports in the continental United States and provides insights into the interactions through which delays propagate through the network and the often-counterintuitive consequences. Delay propagation tends to ``smoothen'' daily airport demand profiles and push more demands into late evening hours. Such phenomena are especially evident at hub airports, where some flights may benefit considerably (by experiencing reduced delays) from the changes that occur in the scheduled demand profile as a result of delays and delay propagation.},

Given a system specification in Signal Temporal Logic (STL), we would like to verify that for all (infinite) values of the model parameters/input signals, the system satisfies its specification. Unfortunately, this problem is undecidable in general. Statistical model checking (SMC) offers a solution by providing guarantees on the correctness of CPS models by statistically reasoning on model simulations. We propose a new approach for statistical verification of CPS models for user-provided distribution on the model parameters. Our technique uses model simulations to learn surrogate models, and uses conformal inference to provide probabilistic guarantees on the satisfaction of a given STL property. Additionally, we can provide prediction intervals containing the quantitative satisfaction values of the given STL property for any user-specified confidence level. We also propose a refinement procedure based on Gaussian Process (GP)-based surrogate models for obtaining fine-grained probabilistic guarantees over sub-regions in the parameter space. This in turn enables the CPS designer to choose assured validity domains in the parameter space for safety-critical applications. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of our technique on several CPS models.},

Specifically, we differentiate the hardness of estimation of test statistics from the hardness of testing whether these statistics are zero or not, and explicitly discuss a notion of "fair" alternative hypotheses for these problems as dimension increases. We then demonstrate that the power of these tests actually drops polynomially with increasing dimension against fair alternatives. We end with some theoretical insights and shed light on the median heuristic for kernel bandwidth selection.

Most applications of variational inference employ simple families of posterior approximations in order to allow for efficient inference, focusing on mean-field or other simple structured approximations. This restriction has a significant impact on the quality of inferences made using variational methods. We introduce a new approach for specifying flexible, arbitrarily complex and scalable approximate posterior distributions. Our approximations are distributions constructed through a normalizing flow, whereby a simple initial density is transformed into a more complex one by applying a sequence of invertible transformations until a desired level of complexity is attained. We use this view of normalizing flows to develop categories of finite and infinitesimal flows and provide a unified view of approaches for constructing rich posterior approximations. We demonstrate that the theoretical advantages of having posteriors that better match the true posterior, combined with the scalability of amortized variational approaches, provides a clear improvement in performance and applicability of variational inference.}

You can use it to perform forward modelling and backpropagation, so it can simulate wave propagation to generate synthetic data, invert for the scattering potential (RTM/LSRTM), other model parameters (FWI), initial wavefields, or source wavelets. You can use it to integrate wave propagation into a larger chain of operations with end-to-end forward and backpropagation. Deepwave enables you to easily experiment with your own objective functions or functions that generate the inputs to the propagator, letting PyTorch's automatic differentiation do the hard work of calculating how to backpropagate through them. To install it, I recommend first installing PyTorch using the instructions on the PyTorch website. Deepwave can then be installed using pip install deepwave The documentation contains examples and instructions on how to install and use Deepwave.

  abstract = {When will automated vehicles come onto the market? This question has puzzled the automotive industry and society for years. The technology and its implementation have made rapid progress over the last decade, but the challenge of how to prove the safety of these systems has not yet been solved. Since a market launch without proof of safety would neither be accepted by society nor by legislators, much time and many resources have been invested into safety assessment in recent years in order to develop new approaches for an efficient assessment. This paper therefore provides an overview of various approaches, and gives a comprehensive survey of the so-called scenario-based approach. The scenario-based approach is a promising method, in which individual traffic situations are typically tested by means of virtual simulation. Since an infinite number of different scenarios can theoretically occur in real-world traffic, even the scenario-based approach leaves the question unanswered as to how to break these down into a finite set of scenarios, and find those which are representative in order to render testing more manageable. This paper provides a comprehensive literature review of related safety-assessment publications that deal precisely with this question. Therefore, this paper develops a novel taxonomy for the scenario-based approach, and classifies all literature sources. Based on this, the existing methods will be compared with each other and, as one conclusion, the alternative concept of formal verification will be combined with the scenario-based approach. Finally, future research priorities are derived.},

  abstract = {Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a powerful modeling tool, able to represent any computable probability distribution. Unfortunately, probabilistic program inference is often intractable, and existing PPLs mostly rely on expensive, approximate sampling-based methods. To alleviate this problem, one could try to learn from past inferences, so that future inferences run faster. This strategy is known as amortized inference; it has recently been applied to Bayesian networks and deep generative models. This paper proposes a system for amortized inference in PPLs. In our system, amortization comes in the form of a parameterized guide program. Guide programs have similar structure to the original program, but can have richer data flow, including neural network components. These networks can be optimized so that the guide approximately samples from the posterior distribution defined by the original program. We present a flexible interface for defining guide programs and a stochastic gradient-based scheme for optimizing guide parameters, as well as some preliminary results on automatically deriving guide programs. We explore in detail the common machine learning pattern in which a 'local' model is specified by 'global' random values and used to generate independent observed data points; this gives rise to amortized local inference supporting global model learning.},

Ideally, the choice of inputs has to be guided by choosing the right input distributions in order to expose corner-case violations. However, this is also known to be a hard problem, in practice. In this paper, we present an application of the cross-entropy method for adaptively choosing input distributions for falsifying temporal logic properties of hybrid systems. We present various choices for representing input distribution families for the cross-entropy method, ranging from a complete partitioning of the input space into cells to a fac-tored distribution of the input using graphical models. Finally, we experimentally compare the falsification approach using the cross-entropy method to other stochastic and heuristic optimization techniques implemented inside the tool S-Taliro over a set of benchmark systems. The performance of the cross entropy method is quite promising. We find that sampling inputs using the cross-entropy method guided by trace robustness can discover violations faster, and more consistently than the other competing methods considered.},

In this paper, we present a novel deep-learning-based robust nonlinear controller (Neural-Lander) that improves control performance of a quadrotor during landing. Our approach combines a nominal dynamics model with a Deep Neural Network (DNN) that learns high-order interactions. We apply spectral normalization (SN) to constrain the Lipschitz constant of the DNN. Leveraging this Lipschitz property, we design a nonlinear feedback linearization controller using the learned model and prove system stability with disturbance rejection. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first DNN-based nonlinear feedback controller with stability guarantees that can utilize arbitrarily large neural nets.

The intruder team tries to score by sending as many intruders as possible to the target area, while the defender team tries to minimize this score by intercepting them. Finding the optimal strategies of the game is challenging due to the high dimensionality of the joint state space. Existing works have proposed approximation methods to reduce the design of the defense strategy into assignment problems, however, they suffer from either suboptimal defender performance or computational complexity. Based on a novel decomposition method, this letter proposes a scalable (polynomial-time) assignment algorithm that accommodates cooperative behaviors and outperforms the existing defense strategies. For a certain class of initial configurations, we derive the exact score by showing that the lower bound provided by the intruder team matches the upper bound provided by the defender team, which also proves the optimality of the team strategies.},

Canonically, the variational principle suggests to prefer an expressive inference model so that the variational approximation is accurate. However, it is often overlooked that an overly-expressive inference model can be detrimental to the test set performance of both the amortized posterior approximator and, more importantly, the generative density estimator. In this paper, we leverage the fact that VAEs rely on amortized inference and propose techniques for amortized inference regularization (AIR) that control the smoothness of the inference model. We demonstrate that, by applying AIR, it is possible to improve VAE generalization on both inference and generative performance. Our paper challenges the belief that amortized inference is simply a mechanism for approximating maximum likelihood training and illustrates that regularization of the amortization family provides a new direction for understanding and improving generalization in VAEs.},

In practice, however, we want much more than that. We want disagreements to be resolved. This leaves us with a substantial knowledge gap, which is often perceived as a lack of practical intuition regarding probabilistic and statistical concepts. Here, we propose to address disagreements using the methods of financial economics. In particular, we show how a large class of disagreements can be transformed into investment opportunities. The expected financial performance of such investments quantifies the amount of disagreement in a tangible way. This provides intuition for statistical concepts such as the R{\'e}nyi divergence, which becomes connected to the financial performance of optimized investments. Investment optimization takes into account individual opinions as well as attitudes towards risk. The result is a market-like social mechanism by which funds flow naturally to support a more accurate view. Such social mechanisms can help us with difficult disagreements (e.g., financial arguments concerning the future climate). In terms of scientific validation, we used the findings of independent neurophysiological experiments as well as our own research on the equity premium.},

Because gradients can be ill-defined and hard to estimate when the data resides on low-dimensional manifolds, we perturb the data with different levels of Gaussian noise, and jointly estimate the corresponding scores, i.e., the vector fields of gradients of the perturbed data distribution for all noise levels. For sampling, we propose an annealed Langevin dynamics where we use gradients corresponding to gradually decreasing noise levels as the sampling process gets closer to the data manifold. Our framework allows flexible model architectures, requires no sampling during training or the use of adversarial methods, and provides a learning objective that can be used for principled model comparisons. Our models produce samples comparable to GANs on MNIST, CelebA and CIFAR-10 datasets, achieving a new state-of-the-art inception score of 8.87 on CIFAR-10. Additionally, we demonstrate that our models learn effective representations via image inpainting experiments.}

  abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of \$1024{\textbackslash}times 1024\$ images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

This approach allows for a full characterization of all possible solutions, and their relative probabilities, whilst simultaneously forcing significant modelling issues to be addressed in a clear and precise fashion. Although expensive to implement, this approach is starting to lie within the range of the available computational resources in many application areas. It also allows for the quantification of uncertainty and risk, something which is increasingly demanded by these applications. Furthermore, the approach is conceptually important for the understanding of simpler, computationally expedient approaches to inverse problems.},

  abstract = {Testing and evaluation is a crucial step in the development and deployment of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). To comprehensively evaluate the performance of CAVs, it is necessary to test the CAVs in safety-critical scenarios, which rarely happen in a naturalistic driving environment. Therefore, how to purposely and systematically generate these corner cases becomes an important problem. Most existing studies focus on generating adversarial examples for perception systems of CAVs, whereas limited efforts have been put into decision-making systems, which is the highlight of this paper. As the CAVs need to interact with numerous background vehicles (BVs) for a long duration, variables that define the corner cases are usually high-dimensional, which makes the generation a challenging problem. In this paper, a unified framework is proposed to generate corner cases for decision-making systems. To address the challenge brought by high dimensionality, the driving environment is formulated based on the Markov decision process, and the deep reinforcement learning techniques are applied to learn the behavior policy of BVs. With the learned policy, BVs behave and interact with the CAVs more aggressively, resulting in more corner cases. To further analyze the generated corner cases, the techniques of feature extraction and clustering are utilized. By selecting representative cases of each cluster and outliers, the valuable corner cases can be identified from all generated corner cases. Simulation results of a highway driving environment show that the proposed methods can effectively generate and identify the valuable corner cases.},

We evaluate the algorithm on a wide variety of benchmarks.

This is, however, a challenging problem due to the difficulty of combining continuous motion planning and discrete task specifications. The optimization-based TAMP with temporal logic specifications is a promising method, but existing works use mixed integer problems (MIP) and do not scale well. To address this issue, in our approach, a new hybrid system model without discrete variables is introduced and combined with smooth approximation methods for STL. This allows the TAMP to be formulated as a nonlinear programming problem whose computational cost is significantly less than that of MIP. Furthermore, it is also possible to deal with nonlinear dynamics and geometric constraints represented by nonlinear functions.

This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to 1.5 cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.},

  abstract = {To navigate complex environments, robots must increasingly use high-dimensional visual feedback (e.g. images) for control. However, relying on high-dimensional image data to make control decisions raises important questions; particularly, how might we prove the safety of a visual-feedback controller? Control barrier functions (CBFs) are powerful tools for certifying the safety of feedback controllers in the state-feedback setting, but CBFs have traditionally been poorly-suited to visual feedback control due to the need to predict future observations in order to evaluate the barrier function. In this work, we solve this issue by leveraging recent advances in neural radiance fields (NeRFs), which learn implicit representations of 3D scenes and can render images from previously-unseen camera perspectives, to provide single-step visual foresight for a CBF-based controller. This novel combination is able to filter out unsafe actions and intervene to preserve safety. We demonstrate the effect of our controller in real-time simulation experiments where it successfully prevents the robot from taking dangerous actions.},

Despite a long tradition of research into conditional density estimation, current methods employ either simple parametric forms or are difficult to learn in practice. This paper employs normalising flows as a flexible likelihood model and presents an efficient method for fitting them to complex densities. These estimators must trade-off between modeling distributional complexity, functional complexity and heteroscedasticity without overfitting. We recognize these trade-offs as modeling decisions and develop a Bayesian framework for placing priors over these conditional density estimators using variational Bayesian neural networks. We evaluate this method on several small benchmark regression datasets, on some of which it obtains state of the art performance. Finally, we apply the method to two spatial density modeling tasks with over 1 million datapoints using the New York City yellow taxi dataset and the Chicago crime dataset.},

By using a squared differential length as a Lyapunov-like function, its nonlinear stability analysis boils down to finding a suitable contraction metric that satisfies a stability condition expressed as a linear matrix inequality, indicating that many parallels can be drawn between well-known linear systems theory and contraction theory for nonlinear systems. Furthermore, contraction theory takes advantage of a superior robustness property of exponential stability used in conjunction with the comparison lemma. This yields much-needed safety and stability guarantees for neural network-based control and estimation schemes, without resorting to a more involved method of using uniform asymptotic stability for input-to-state stability. Such distinctive features permit systematic construction of a contraction metric via convex optimization, thereby obtaining an explicit exponential bound on the distance between a time-varying target trajectory and solution trajectories perturbed externally due to disturbances and learning errors. The objective of this paper is therefore to present a tutorial overview of contraction theory and its advantages in nonlinear stability analysis of deterministic and stochastic systems, with an emphasis on deriving formal robustness and stability guarantees for various learning-based and data-driven automatic control methods. In particular, we provide a detailed review of techniques for finding contraction metrics and associated control and estimation laws using deep neural networks.},

The overall mission specification consists of a temporal logic statement over a set of static, a priori known requests, and a servicing priority order over a set of dynamic requests that can be sensed locally. Our approach is based on two main steps. First, we construct an abstraction for the motion of the vehicle in the environment by using input output linearization and assignment of vector fields to the regions in the partition. Second, a receding horizon controller computes local plans within the sensing range of the vehicle such that both local and global mission specifications are satisfied.

Despite the ubiquity of partial observability in practice, theoretical guarantees for direct policy search algorithms, one of the backbones of modern reinforcement learning, have proven difficult to achieve. This is primarily due to the degeneracies which arise when optimizing over filters that maintain internal state. In this paper, we provide a new perspective on this challenging problem based on the notion of \${\textbackslash}textit\{informativity\}\$, which intuitively requires that all components of a filter's internal state are representative of the true state of the underlying dynamical system. We show that informativity overcomes the aforementioned degeneracy. Specifically, we propose a \${\textbackslash}textit\{regularizer\}\$ which explicitly enforces informativity, and establish that gradient descent on this regularized objective - combined with a ``reconditioning step'' - converges to the globally optimal cost a \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}(1/T)\$ rate. Our analysis relies on several new results which may be of independent interest, including a new framework for analyzing non-convex gradient descent via convex reformulation, and novel bounds on the solution to linear Lyapunov equations in terms of (our quantitative measure of) informativity.},

  abstract = {Autonomous vehicles must often contend with conflicting planning requirements, e.g., safety and comfort could be at odds with each other if avoiding a collision calls for slamming the brakes. To resolve such conflicts, assigning importance ranking to rules (i.e., imposing a rule hierarchy) has been proposed, which, in turn, induces rankings on trajectories based on the importance of the rules they satisfy. On one hand, imposing rule hierarchies can enhance interpretability, but introduce combinatorial complexity to planning; while on the other hand, differentiable reward structures can be leveraged by modern gradient-based optimization tools, but are less interpretable and unintuitive to tune. In this paper, we present an approach to equivalently express rule hierarchies as differentiable reward structures amenable to modern gradient-based optimizers, thereby, achieving the best of both worlds. We achieve this by formulating rank-preserving reward functions that are monotonic in the rank of the trajectories induced by the rule hierarchy; i.e., higher ranked trajectories receive higher reward. Equipped with a rule hierarchy and its corresponding rank-preserving reward function, we develop a two-stage planner that can efficiently resolve conflicting planning requirements. We demonstrate that our approach can generate motion plans in {\textasciitilde}7-10 Hz for various challenging road navigation and intersection negotiation scenarios.},

Nevertheless, min-max optimization beyond the purpose of AT has not been rigorously explored in the adversarial context. In this paper, we show how a general notion of min-max optimization over multiple domains can be leveraged to the design of different types of adversarial attacks. In particular, given a set of risk sources, minimizing the worst-case attack loss can be reformulated as a min-max problem by introducing domain weights that are maximized over the probability simplex of the domain set. We showcase this unified framework in three attack generation problems -- attacking model ensembles, devising universal perturbation under multiple inputs, and crafting attacks resilient to data transformations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach leads to substantial attack improvement over the existing heuristic strategies as well as robustness improvement over state-of-the-art defense methods against multiple perturbation types. Furthermore, we find that the self-adjusted domain weights learned from min-max optimization can provide a holistic tool to explain the difficulty level of attack across domains.},

Recently, Few-shot Learning (FSL) is proposed to tackle this problem. Using prior knowledge, FSL can rapidly generalize to new tasks containing only a few samples with supervised information. In this article, we conduct a thorough survey to fully understand FSL. Starting from a formal definition of FSL, we distinguish FSL from several relevant machine learning problems. We then point out that the core issue in FSL is that the empirical risk minimizer is unreliable. Based on how prior knowledge can be used to handle this core issue, we categorize FSL methods from three perspectives: (i) data, which uses prior knowledge to augment the supervised experience; (ii) model, which uses prior knowledge to reduce the size of the hypothesis space; and (iii) algorithm, which uses prior knowledge to alter the search for the best hypothesis in the given hypothesis space. With this taxonomy, we review and discuss the pros and cons of each category. Promising directions, in the aspects of the FSL problem setups, techniques, applications, and theories, are also proposed to provide insights for future research.1},

In our framework, the master problem makes unit commitment decisions and the subproblem discovers the worst-case contingency scenarios. By using linearization techniques and duality theory, we transform the subproblem into a mixed-integer linear program (MILP). The most violated inequalities generated from the subproblem are fed back into the master problem during each iteration. Our approach guarantees a globally optimal solution in a finite number of iterations. In reported computational experiments, we test both primal and dual decomposition approaches.

In this process, continuous inputs such as velocities result in an infinite number of possible variations of a scenario. Thus, metamodels are used to perform analyses or to select specific variations for examination. However, despite the safety criticality of AV testing, metamodels are usually seen as a part of an overall approach, and their predictions are not questioned. This paper analyzes the predictive performance of Gaussian processes (GP), deep Gaussian processes, extra-trees, and Bayesian neural networks (BNN), considering four scenarios with 5 to 20 inputs. Building on this, an iterative approach is introduced and evaluated, which allows to efficiently select test cases for common analysis tasks. The results show that regarding predictive performance, the appropriate selection of test cases is more important than the choice of metamodels. However, the choice of metamodels remains crucial: Their great flexibility allows BNNs to benefit from large amounts of data and to model even the most complex scenarios. In contrast, less flexible models like GPs convince with higher reliability. Hence, relevant test cases are best explored using scalable virtual test setups and flexible models. Subsequently, more realistic test setups and more reliable models can be used for targeted testing and validation.},

  abstract = {Deep learning has revolutionized many machine learning tasks in recent years, ranging from image classification and video processing to speech recognition and natural language understanding. The data in these tasks are typically represented in the Euclidean space. However, there is an increasing number of applications, where data are generated from non-Euclidean domains and are represented as graphs with complex relationships and interdependency between objects. The complexity of graph data has imposed significant challenges on the existing machine learning algorithms. Recently, many studies on extending deep learning approaches for graph data have emerged. In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of graph neural networks (GNNs) in data mining and machine learning fields. We propose a new taxonomy to divide the state-of-The-Art GNNs into four categories, namely, recurrent GNNs, convolutional GNNs, graph autoencoders, and spatial-Temporal GNNs. We further discuss the applications of GNNs across various domains and summarize the open-source codes, benchmark data sets, and model evaluation of GNNs. Finally, we propose potential research directions in this rapidly growing field.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning can generate complex control policies, but requires large amounts of training data to work effectively. Recent work has attempted to address this issue by leveraging differentiable simulators. However, inherent problems such as local minima and exploding/vanishing numerical gradients prevent these methods from being generally applied to control tasks with complex contact-rich dynamics, such as humanoid locomotion in classical RL benchmarks. In this work we present a high-performance differentiable simulator and a new policy learning algorithm (SHAC) that can effectively leverage simulation gradients, even in the presence of non-smoothness. Our learning algorithm alleviates problems with local minima through a smooth critic function, avoids vanishing/exploding gradients through a truncated learning window, and allows many physical environments to be run in parallel. We evaluate our method on classical RL control tasks, and show substantial improvements in sample efficiency and wall-clock time over state-of-the-art RL and differentiable simulation-based algorithms. In addition, we demonstrate the scalability of our method by applying it to the challenging high-dimensional problem of muscle-actuated locomotion with a large action space, achieving a greater than \$17{\textbackslash}times\$ reduction in training time over the best-performing established RL algorithm.

  abstract = {This paper proposes a methodology for enhancing the power system flexibility, which can respond properly to contingencies in real-time operations. The proposed approach introduces a unified power flow controller (UPFC) in a three-stage security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF). The pre- and post-contingency system operation states are divided into three stages including the base case, post-contingency short-term, and post-contingency long-term periods. The UPFC applications re-route active power flow and provide reactive power to mitigate overloads and voltage violations when line outages occur in power systems. UPFC is adopted as a fast-response corrective control device during the post-contingency short-term period, which is coordinated with the conventional slow-response corrective control system during the post-contingency long-term period. A convex approach is applied to reformulate the original nonlinear nonconvex SCOPF problem into a second-order cone programming (SOCP) problem. A two-level algorithm using Benders decomposition and sequential cone programming (SCP) is applied to solve the large-scale SOCP problem. An improved covering cut bundle (CCB) strategy is proposed to accelerate the convergence of the Benders decomposition algorithm. Numerical results show the effectiveness of the proposed model and its solution technique for enhancing the power system flexibility.},

We also add auxiliary variables to approximate the membership functions in the functional such that Chambolle's fast dual projection method can be used. An alternate minimization method can be employed to find the solution, in which the region parameters and the membership functions have closed form solutions. Numerical examples using grayscale and color images are given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

We develop an algorithm that searches for ``adversarial scenarios'', which can be thought of as the strategy for the adversary representing the noise and disturbances, that lead to safety violations. The main challenge is to analyze the closed-loop system's vulnerabilities with a potentially complex or even unknown controller in the loop. As opposed to commonly adopted approaches that treat the system under test as a black-box, we propose a synthesis-guided approach, which leverages the knowledge of a plant model at hand. This hence leads to a way to deal with gray-box systems (i.e., with known plant and unknown controller). Our approach reveals the role of the imperfect information in the violation. Examples show that our approach can find non-trivial scenarios that are difficult to expose by random simulations. This approach is further extended to incorporate model mismatch and to falsify vision-in-the-loop systems against finite-time reach-avoid specifications.},

We evaluated our approach on 24 adversarial defenses and show that it outperforms AutoAttack, the current state-of-the-art tool for reliable evaluation of adversarial defenses: our tool discovered significantly stronger attacks by producing 3.0\%-50.8\% additional adversarial examples for 10 models, while obtaining attacks with slightly stronger or similar strength for the remaining models.},

Using the theory of stochastic partial differential equations, this model quantifies the uncertainties in the parameter space by means of the integrated nested Laplace approximation. In resolution tests using simulated data and in inversions using real data, our model matches the performance of conventional deterministic optimization approaches in retrieving three-dimensional structure of the Earth's mantle. In addition it delivers estimates of the full parameter covariance matrix.

Due to the complexity and uncertainty of the driving environment, and the complexity of the driving task itself, the number of possible driving scenarios that an ADS or ADAS may encounter is virtually infinite. Therefore it is essential to be able to reason about the identification of scenarios and in particular critical ones that may impose unacceptable risk if not considered. Critical scenarios are particularly important to support design, verification and validation efforts, and as a basis for a safety case. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic literature review in the context of autonomous driving. The main contributions are: (i) introducing a comprehensive taxonomy for critical scenario identification methods; (ii) giving an overview of the state-of-the-art research based on the taxonomy encompassing 86 papers between 2017 and 2020; and (iii) identifying open issues and directions for further research. The provided taxonomy comprises three main perspectives encompassing the problem definition (the why), the solution (the methods to derive scenarios), and the assessment of the established scenarios.

  abstract = {Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) are widely adopted in safety-critical domains, raising great demands on their quality assurance. However, the application of formal verification is limited due to the continuous dynamics of CPSs. Instead, simulation-based falsification, which aims at finding a counterexample to refute the system specification, is a more feasible and hence actively pursued approach. Falsification adopts an optimization approach, treating robustness, given by the quantitative semantics of the specification language (usually Signal Temporal Logic (STL)), as the objective function. However, similarly to traditional testing, in the absence of found counterexamples, falsification does not give any guarantee on the system safety. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose a confidence measure that estimates the probability that a formal specification is indeed not falsifiable, by relying on the information encapsulated in the simulation data collected during falsification. Methodologically, we approximate the robustness domain by feeding simulation data into a Gaussian Process (GP) Regression process; we then do a minimization sampling on the trained GP, and then estimate the probability that all the robustness values inferred from these sampled points are positive; we take this probability as the confidence measure. We experimentally study the properties of monotonicity and soundness of the proposed confidence measure. We also apply the measure to several state-of-the-art falsification algorithms to assess the maximum confidence they provide when they do not find a falsifying input, and the stability of such confidence across different repetitions.},

In contrast, physics-based differentiable rendering algorithms focus on computing derivative of images exhibiting complex light transport effects (e.g., soft shadows, interreflection, and caustics) with respect to arbitrary scene parameters such as camera pose, object geometry (e.g., vertex positions) as well as spatially varying material properties expressed as 2D textures and 3D volumes. This new level of generality has made physics-based differentiable rendering a key ingredient for solving many challenging inverse-rendering problems, that is, the search of scene configurations optimizing user-specified objective functions, using gradient-based methods (as illustrated in the figure below). Further, these techniques can be incorporated into probabilistic inference and machine learning pipelines. For instance, differentiable renderers allow "rendering losses" to be computed with complex light transport effects captured. Additionally, they can be used as generative models that synthesize photorealistic images.},

Typical heuristic-based traffic models offer flexible control to make vehicles follow specific trajectories and traffic rules. On the other hand, data-driven approaches generate realistic and human-like behaviors, improving transfer from simulated to real-world traffic. However, to the best of our knowledge, no traffic model offers both controllability and realism. In this work, we develop a conditional diffusion model for controllable traffic generation (CTG) that allows users to control desired properties of trajectories at test time (e.g., reach a goal or follow a speed limit) while maintaining realism and physical feasibility through enforced dynamics. The key technical idea is to leverage recent advances from diffusion modeling and differentiable logic to guide generated trajectories to meet rules defined using signal temporal logic (STL). We further extend guidance to multi-agent settings and enable interaction-based rules like collision avoidance. CTG is extensively evaluated on the nuScenes dataset for diverse and composite rules, demonstrating improvement over strong baselines in terms of the controllability-realism tradeoff.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a stochastic search algorithm for solving general optimization problems with little structure. The algorithm iteratively finds high quality solutions by randomly sampling candidate solutions from a parameterized distribution model over the solution space. The basic idea is to convert the original (possibly non-differentiable) problem into a differentiable optimization problem on the parameter space of the parameterized sampling distribution, and then use a direct gradient search method to find improved sampling distributions. Thus, the algorithm combines the robustness feature of stochastic search from considering a population of candidate solutions with the relative fast convergence speed of classical gradient methods by exploiting local differentiable structures. We analyze the convergence and converge rate properties of the proposed algorithm, and carry out numerical study to illustrate its performance.},

  abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) is arguably the dominant statistical inference algorithm used in most popular "first-order differentiable" Probabilistic Programming Languages (PPLs). However, the fact that HMC uses derivative information causes complications when the target distribution is non-differentiable with respect to one or more of the latent variables. In this paper, we show how to use extensions to HMC to perform inference in probabilistic programs that contain discontinuities. To do this, we design a Simple first-order Probabilistic Programming Language (SPPL) that contains a sufficient set of language restrictions together with a compilation scheme. This enables us to preserve both the statistical and syntactic interpretation of if-else statements in the probabilistic program, within the scope of first-order PPLs. We also provide a corresponding mathematical formalism that ensures any joint density denoted in such a language has a suitably low measure of discontinuities.},

  abstract = {As robots are deployed in complex situations, engineers and end users must develop a holistic understanding of their behaviors, capabilities, and limitations. Some behaviors are directly optimized by the objective function. They often include success rate, completion time or energy consumption. Other behaviors -- e.g., collision avoidance, trajectory smoothness or motion legibility -- are typically emergent but equally important for safe and trustworthy deployment. Designing an objective which optimizes every aspect of robot behavior is hard. In this paper, we advocate for systematic analysis of a wide array of behaviors for holistic understanding of robot controllers and, to this end, propose a framework, RoCUS, which uses Bayesian posterior sampling to find situations where the robot controller exhibits user-specified behaviors, such as highly jerky motions. We use RoCUS to analyze three controller classes (deep learning models, rapidly exploring random trees and dynamical system formulations) on two domains (2D navigation and a 7 degree-of-freedom arm reaching), and uncover insights to further our understanding of these controllers and ultimately improve their designs.},

  abstract = {MATPOWER is an open-source Matlab-based power system simulation package that provides a high-level set of power flow, optimal power flow (OPF), and other tools targeted toward researchers, educators, and students. The OPF architecture is designed to be extensible, making it easy to add user-defined variables, costs, and constraints to the standard OPF problem. This paper presents the details of the network modeling and problem formulations used by MATPOWER, including its extensible OPF architecture. This structure is used internally to implement several extensions to the standard OPF problem, including piece-wise linear cost functions, dispatchable loads, generator capability curves, and branch angle difference limits. Simulation results are presented for a number of test cases comparing the performance of several available OPF solvers and demonstrating MATPOWER's ability to solve large-scale AC and DC OPF problems.},
